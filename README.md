# SuggestionMining
Mining suggestion or non-suggestion sentences.

Suggestion mining can be defined as the extraction of suggestions from unstructured text, where the term 'suggestions' refers to the expressions of tips, advice, recommendations etc. Consumer opinions towards commercial entities like brands, services, and products are generally expressed through online reviews, blogs, discussion forums, or social media platforms. These opinions largely express positive and negative sentiments towards a given entity, but also tend to contain suggestions for improvising the entity or tips to the fellow consumers. 

Traditional opinion mining systems mainly focus on automatically calculating the sentiment distribution towards an entity of interest by means of Sentiment Analysis methods. A suggestion mining component can extend the capabilities of traditional opinion mining systems, which can then cater to additional applications. Such systems can empower both public and private sectors by extracting the suggestions which are spontaneously expressed on various online platforms, enabling the organisations to collect suggestions from much larger and varied sources of opinions than the traditional suggestion box or online feedback forms
