__label__0 The token I was asking for was present in the FutureAccessList but it gave me a FileNotFoundException.
__label__1 Why don't you use the WinPho style?
__label__0 if I choose device I get a generic error (vie tried every suggestion I can find online) if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin so I go into the for devs page on my device and I hit pair and I get a 6 digit pin.
__label__0 These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).
__label__0 The new way to move the cursor with the finger to edit a word is terrible in Win8.1.
__label__0 The UpdateTask or PreConfigurationTask capabilities are good examples.
__label__1 Again, super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than Chrome (a life saver since I can only use IE on my Windows RT Tablet), but this needs to be fixed eventually.
__label__0 When you create a tile dynamically, it is common to want to save it as a Png file so that it uses transparency (so that it respects the theme accent color).
__label__1 Fix Altitude Bug in GeoCoordinateWatcher and Geolocator when using in WP8.
__label__0 When using MapElement derived controls, such as MapPolygon, expose a Tap event.
__label__0 If I am lucky I can do it before my character dies, even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere by the time I actually take the screenshot.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to assign a (compiled) binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors.
__label__1 We need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using IE, they can choose installed application to open with.
__label__0 I don't know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it right now.
__label__0 It is because the responsible HTML element c-heading class font-size style property is fixed to 15px.
__label__1 Alternatively it would be nice if the UWP platform was updated separately from Windows so apps would be able to support all the new Controls/Styles.
__label__0 I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas.
__label__0 What do you prefer?
__label__0 etc.
__label__0 It's awkward to have different means of resizing objects.
__label__0 It's a lot easier to build a following when it's free.
__label__0 An example of the first might be: ______I____ve heard that Wordament is good, so I____ll type ______Wordament____ into the search box so I can download and play it during my commute to work__.
__label__0 I tried everything, then used system restore to restore to the previous restore point, that___ more
__label__0 To load the mobile turn off and the alarm works with the phone off to my core.
__label__1 It would be nice if Runs / Spans inside a Richtextblock / Textblock could support more formatting properties like CSS - i.e. setting background color or a word, putting a border around a word, strikethrough, etc.

Currently it's difficult to do some of these things.

Nesting UIContainers inside of a RichTextBlock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text.
__label__1 In browser apps will need to be sand boxed without elevated trust permissions In-browser deployment was an excellent feature of Silverlight.
__label__1 It would be convenient to have a SelectedBackground property for CalendarView.
__label__1 Deploy the latest version of Feedly so that I can update the app on my Kindle Fire
__label__1 So my opinion is to create two new controls.

__label__1 The software NEEDS access to sky / one drive or a option so you can send files you have stored on there.
__label__0 Currently an evaluation which Downloads were billed at which Price is not possible.
__label__0 Currently, the only options I have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze, or ignore or the back button.
__label__0 These feedbacks were all refused, and I can imagine the motivation behind this, so I try to formulate better what's really the point is on this: If a developer has many unpublished apps or IAPs their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not (more) relevant data regarding to app that there aren't no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now.
__label__0 For instance, Feedpress can't see how many people subscribe to feeds through Feedly.	
__label__0 We are not willing to charge less in US or Canada than in Europe 2.
__label__1 You should put the shuffle, repeat and like buttons in the pop-up music menu
__label__0 Thanks!

__label__0 This is a privacy fault since I cannot delete all internet stored data connected to this id.
__label__0 call without having to wait on Microsoft to do that.
__label__0 Also the AudioGraph can't to be ensure generate 10ms of AudioFrame data even though I have set the QuantumSizeSelectionMode property to ClosestToDesired.
__label__0 I looked through the GUID-named folder and found no SHARED folder inside.
__label__0 I logged out of then back into the Feedly account in Mr. Reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order.
__label__0 This could be fixed.
__label__0 Enable a code-once and runs on Windows or Phone.
__label__0 This is one of my primary use flows and a big bummer as I use two factor authentication on Evernote.
__label__0 This submission went through smoothly.
__label__0 If you don't fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly.
__label__0 Hate turning down games and music volume then I can't hear my phone ring later when i forget to turn volume back up
__label__1 Please take this into consideration and make the ID public (maybe with a new capability requirement).
__label__0 In the upload website, a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once.
__label__0 What do you prefer?
__label__0 Obviously the free SDK is a good start.
__label__0 Some want a tool that satisfies their need, not create problems.
__label__1 If I could add individual users as a feed, then I could see their updates without having to scroll through Facebook's ridiculous wall.
__label__1 Allow the ability to Open the Explorer and show a selected file in the Explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible.
__label__0 Siamo indietro rispetto al Mac!
__label__0 I could only___ more

__label__0 The issue seems to be somewhere in Windows.UI.Xaml.dll!TextBlockViewHelpers::AdjustPositionByCharacterCount().
__label__0 The WithEvents clause in VB.NET allows to add handler methods the VS code designer by selecting the events from a ComboBox at the window top.
__label__0 This would be really helpful when it comes to upcoming Fluent Design supporting new Fluent Design Styles and Supporting the Design Waves.
__label__1 I think that app should have two ratings: one from Windows Phone 8.1 users visible to people having Windows Phone 8.1 and second one from Windows 10 Mobile users visible to Windows 10 users.
__label__0 On Android, there is a great app that lets you backup your SMS messages.
__label__0 Why do you always have to make a developer's life difficult.
__label__0 Obviously Not.
__label__1 Please add Shell Context Menus API for UWP apps.
__label__1 For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone, but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone (maybe timed, maybe because user presses a button on the phone) to send a request, which the service on the phone then handles (some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved) The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories.
__label__0 Video overlay support for example picture in picture
__label__0 It keeps resetting to unchecked (so the sort is newest first the next time you enter that category.
__label__0 This is the most important feature lacking in___ more

__label__0 It didn't do this before the latest update.
__label__0 I just chatted to support, they told me that it was because the name was too generic.

__label__1 Please make an app for blackberry playbook, because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook.
__label__0 We're limited at work since we can't use our mobile devices the way we want...
__label__1 When we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook, it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it.
__label__0 To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in it's constructor.
__label__0 Not even if the IAPs are completely removed from the app and deleted from the developer account.
__label__0 So what is the suggestion?
__label__1 Enable Linux devices to be included in a user’s device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
__label__1 I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder, to make them available offline.
__label__0 There are a lot of ms-settings:*** commands to launch different settings pages from code on HoloLens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings.
__label__0 Wack show An error occurred while generating the report.
__label__0 Would also mitigate this:
__label__1 just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a 2.5kg laptop wherever he goes...
__label__0 This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar ItemClicked event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.
__label__1 Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device (e.g.
__label__0 (neither foreground nor FullTrustProcess)
__label__0 BingMapsDirectionsTask, Only set start point, when the task is running, it's prompt Getting directions , it's alert End point not found, we couldn't find a match for your ending point.

__label__0 Do stuff now that the service is registered.
__label__0 If a URL is required then either I have to use something like OneDrive which I think looks a bit unprofessional or I have to create a web page which requires hosting etc and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember.
__label__0 Practically nothing is off limits to the developer hungry for power, but you don____t need to sacrifice productivity or safety along the way.

__label__0 From the build 17711 Windows.ApplicationModel.AppService.AppServiceConnection.OpenAsync() consistently returns 'Unknown Error'.
__label__0 If NavigationService.Navigate() would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI, it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows.
__label__0 There are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed.
__label__0 Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaPlayer.Queue.Activesong populates the .Artist property for music *streamed* from Zune, but not the .Name property, so devs can't know what song is playing.
__label__1 And using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say Hey cortana  MY COMMAND but without voice interaction.
__label__1 Please Combine All Windows Phone SKDs into one installation File, so people download only one file and then check each version of WP SDKs that they want to install.
__label__0 I really want the Universal Apps to grow more powerful.
__label__0 When scrolling down list or opening item in list, app catalog hangs.
__label__0 This panel is similar to a StackPanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down.
__label__0 As example for an obvious issue and easy solution, if you know something about the problem: My app failed certification because of dark/light theme problems.
__label__0 We now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top, after it has been loaded.
__label__1 If all 3 variations could be merged I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future.
__label__0 The WebProxy property does not seem to have an impact on Windows 10 systems.
__label__0 does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration, and in the case of some people (although hopefully not many, and definitely not me), a reason to leave .
__label__0 I hope it's right.
__label__0 A few words about problem context:

__label__0 Personally I won't enable XBox without having tested my app first - at least in an emulator.
__label__1 Easy access to the Bing Music API would be really useful, especially for apps with artist/song recognition.
__label__0 That is irritating actually.
__label__0 It takes advantage of C++11 and beyond to provide a truly modern language projection for the Windows Runtime.
__label__0 With default options etc...
__label__1 It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 Apparently the UIElement.KeyUp and UIElement.KeyDown events provide the wrong VirtualKey information in the KeyRoutedEventArgs.
__label__0 Apps Quest submission doesn't work.
__label__0 Before receiving an UDP message a message has to be send (using sockets).
__label__1 Also if the new Map has route feature it should be usable.
__label__1 It would be very useful to add this feature into Hosted Web Apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a Hosted Web App.

__label__0 Target version: Windows 10 (10.0; Build 10586)
__label__0 As app developers we are currently stuck with 2 methods of generating revenues 1) one time app payment 2) Ads.
__label__0 It was a great idea, and i'm sad to see it go with the Zune HD and not move over to Windows Phone
__label__0 I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so /context command is not provided.
__label__0 It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.
__label__0 Currently when the dialogue with first level of Windows Phone Store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding.
__label__1 The date drop down in the Windows Dev Center needs to have custom date so the developers can see the total download of their application of any interval they enter.
__label__1 2. please set some heat sensing app by default in your Windows before it is too late.
__label__0 I have a jabber-Account GoogleTalk.

__label__1 it will be gode to can add custom sound to Toas notifications
__label__0 Say you have two menu items one Home and the other Whatever.
__label__0 When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems.
__label__0 In short, now that we can have multiple tiles, sure, it's great that they can open the app.
__label__1 Please add back support for Remote Desktop Services objects for Windows 10 Universal Apps or provide an alternative for same.

Remote Desktop Services objects for Windows Store apps are no longer available for use as of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.

Please refer, https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974571.aspx It is necessary for creating screen sharing or remote desktop apps.
__label__0 Currently multichannel audio is downmixed to stereo.
__label__0 Other competitors such as Citrix and HP have already solved this issue with their own Remote Desktop clients.
__label__0 As a self-learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things.
__label__0 The FileOpenPicker has the SuggestedStartLocation and the official description of how it works is:
__label__1 Maybe you should consider including the plugin in the Firefox Addon repo/marketplace.
__label__0 It's frustrating that I don't need to remember passwords anymore when I'm using Safari but I need to exit Feedly, go to Settings> Safari>Passwords>look for the site>copy password>go to Feedly again and paste password.
__label__0 Currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation.
__label__0 Also some way to change (enhance) audio/video captured from mic/camera before it will be encoded and saved into file.
__label__0 In phone setting missing direct commands for enable/disable/verify
__label__0 In UWP we have a CommandBar but it seems it's not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application.
__label__1 Allow other formats than PCM and float for a FrameOutputNode created with CreateFrameOutputNode of class AudioGraph.
__label__0 Can you at least give an option to make the CameraCaptureUI fullscreen?
__label__0 I'm developing a Windows Universal App and I'm sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local DB support.
__label__0 At high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: An unhandled win32 exception occured in <app> [17800]
__label__0 Now that we have a wonderfully awesome Evernote integration, it's time to make it easier to use.
__label__1 Would like to see an improvement in MapPolyLine that allows multiple Individual Segments that have there own properties i.e.
__label__0 When you add an element as an overlay over the MapControl and this element has IsHitTestVisible=False, MapHolding, MapElementClick, etc..

events are not raised.
__label__1 UWP should include a Augmented reality SDK simlar to Apple ARKit and Google AR Dev Kit
__label__0 Internet explorer keeps running in background and is always visible while back button is kept pressed.
__label__1 Net standard should be used by UWP and not limited by it.
__label__0 I've been wondering if something can be done through the silverlight, but all that failed since read that.
__label__1 Having tap always open a foreground tab is okay, but probably better to be configurable.
__label__0 This is going to be a nightmare to maintain in the app store.
__label__0 UWP classes seem not to support WithEvents.
__label__0 On Android devices it is hard to add new feeds to Feedly.	
__label__0 This has broken my app Swipe Tunes as I hastilly submitted a WP8.1 update with Transparent Tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc.
__label__1 Merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly.
__label__0 Having a pop-up window open is pretty clunky.
__label__1 QRCode should support chinese
__label__0 Otherwise AR scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices.
__label__1 basically instead of having to manually install the Firefox plugin every time there's an update, it should auto update.	
__label__1 Add Tumblr Service Too
__label__0 Some apps don't work in background well.

Downloads may breaks when apps switched.

For example, it's better that browser can load a page while i'm switching on another application.
__label__1 I think Windows Phone should make that happen in conjunction with their supporting Xamarin... and potentially hire me as a developer to help.
__label__1 I would like to add a AnimatedHeaderedTextBox control to the Toolkit.
__label__1 I'm looking for a consistent experience.
__label__0 Currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have.
__label__1 In webb for HoloLens Running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a app/process is running
__label__0 UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third-class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP!
__label__1 I would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my YouTube feeds from within Feedly.
__label__0 This is very limited and also time consuming.
__label__0 However this is impossible with all existing API's.
__label__0 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__label__0 And because the same app runs on tablets and PC's, our engineers can work in the field, come back to their office, and continue working with the same data on their PC's.
__label__1 It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts, and waiting to be featured just isn't worth it.
__label__1 From now onward please add Sync() methods first and optionally add supplementary Async() method for long operations.
__label__0 To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in it's constructor.
__label__0 It's so powerful and still human readable.
__label__0 I filed one against a Microsoft example on Github here:
__label__0 It appears that the MapIcon rendering by the MapControl has changed significantly with the Windows 10 Creators update.
__label__0 I guess it can fitt by 4 app icon ib each row.
__label__0 ?.xml for their build environment!
__label__1 Provide the html code with your other buttons.
__label__1 If it's an issue virtualize the registry as with the Desktop Bridge.
__label__0 It's nice to have a notification from a news for example and be able to read a short extract but it should go further in the experience - dynamic and rich notifications - displayed on a gesture on the left side of the home screen (from edge swipe such as W8.1 does for apps running) - make the lock screen customizable with more than only 5 app and make the icons openable on tap (instead of unrolling the notif center form top) I'm a bit surprise by the Action Center.
__label__0 Here is the full error record:
__label__0 As i press home button, it takes approx 5 seconds, for home screen to appear.
__label__1 I'd love to be able to export all of my saved for later articles to my kindle so I can read it via e-ink.	
__label__0 What Would Improve Usability?
__label__0 Currently when using WriteableBitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the UI thread.
__label__0 I can log in to Feedly, that works fine.
__label__0 Not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the VS list.
__label__0 In my case I'm writing an app where you learn how to spell and don't want to give the user any hints :-)
__label__0 And the RelativeTime it seems not correct sometimes the Duration is larger than RelativeTime.
__label__0 I can only play them from the e-mail directly but it's not possible to save them to your phone memory.
__label__1 Would be good if some of these tools could be developed by the support of cellular data in the network api
__label__1 We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler
__label__0 You can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the RFC.

__label__0 I've encountered an issue in Background Audio behavior dependent on app's name.

__label__0 and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example) For my app I have it in about 36 language/Country descriptions which is a big task to handle.
__label__0 However, in some scenarios they do not make sense.
__label__1 Some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards.
__label__1 I strongly think that more background color's should be there, like instead of just black and white, have blue, red, green and stuff___ more
__label__0 Type multiple number with semi colon separated : For example : 1234;5678;9012; 2.)

__label__0 Trying to bind to a Uri will either throw an exception or give a compiler error (I can't remember which) and certainly won't display an image.
__label__0 I have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix I need to be able to compile with the Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows 8 (Xaml).
__label__1 Therefore it would be nice to have an option like XsltSettings.EnableDocumentFunction Property in .NET apps.
__label__0 Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification.

__label__0 CANT WORK WITHOUT IT !!
__label__0 Like on twitter, sometimes we cant follow during viewing a profile.
__label__0 Increases User Experience.
__label__0 So I am using URL for recent uploads from a YouTube account, example: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUISPcad-6svNxgViVr_syvA;
__label__0 These services would be in charge of running the API and posting the data and could take the form of an implementable interface such as a ILinkSharer or something similar allowing the windows phone sharing interface to constantly expand and become dynamic, tailored to the users needs while removing the requirement for Microsoft to make the updates (As the Zune attempted to do with it's apps, a bad idea).
__label__0 The same for Twitter.
__label__0 There is only one direction for the radial progress bar control (clockwise).
__label__1 I have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so I can simply click the Evernote icon and voila, the article saved to my default notebook.
__label__0 There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first 38 characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit.
__label__1 The managed SDK should add support for using SSL client certificates, for SSL Mutual-Authentication in HttpWebRequest and/or Web Service proxy classes.
__label__0 Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the UI Toolkit
__label__0 This is useful for techs using mdm systems - for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support, they can request a screen capture and help them resolve.
__label__0 I disabled the AV the result is unsucceesful.
__label__1 It would be great, if google+ button opened an app on iOS(if it is installed).
__label__0 Google reader API allows to create feeds like i.e. http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/99999/state/com.google/starred.
__label__1 So we need improvement TimeTrigger class with AlarmApplicationManager accuracy.
__label__0 I understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from.

__label__0 I rarely use Google Plus, but there are few very interesting people using it who's post I'd like to read.	
__label__0 The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it (same filename) the create date stays the same!
__label__0 This is also completely secure because the runtime can analyze the class (and it's IL) being submitted.
__label__0 This is currently not really possible.
__label__0 I hope this idea is useful, and perhaps others could comment on whether it is practical, easily implemented or not, and any enhancements.

__label__0 Adding visbility to the battery mAh would then allow battery health apps, charger comparisons, and inductive charger efficiency (or inneficiency).
__label__1 change 1 bit in ZIP64 files to better comply with ISO-21320-1:2015 and normative APPNOTES from PKWARE in order to interoperate with other unzip software.
__label__0 Often, this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for RSS feeds that you might want to subscribe to.
__label__0 The restrictions on the calendar edit/delete are rediculous.
__label__0 This was probably done as a performance optimization; however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI.
__label__0 Clicking the Instapaper button in feedly opens a new browser window on the Instapaper site, and then I have to wait for it to load my account and then I have to click another button to save the article.

__label__0 Unable to enable Cortana in windows 10 mobile emulator.
__label__0 It is ok that some things will be awailable on Windows 8/9 devices which are not available on Windows Phone 8 / 9 and vice versa.
__label__0 Fast resume has pretty much killed my app and I can't delete the WP8.1 XAP from the store, and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the WP Store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers.
__label__0 This question is not because bizview is my own app, the question is for_____ more

__label__0 This is a standard feature for other platforms.
__label__0 Until Windows [Phone] 8.1 this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work.
__label__0 Would like to make a dialer application that would call through a list of numbers through the web, notate what happened on the call (keyboard or buttons) then automatically launch next call.
__label__0 Feedly is beautiful, and I would love to use it on my Windows 8 Phone
__label__0 The direct posting from the feedly to the yammer is much preferred by many of enterprise business persons.
__label__1 It would be extremely helpful to be able to create MediaSourceStreams for audio streams in the Vorbis and/or Opus formats.
__label__0 Hi i am using 720....i upgrade my cell with 8.1 from developers preview.
__label__0 magic wand to remember login, getting tired of retyping my emailaddress and password on every login.
__label__0 Why are you limiting UWP and DirectX12 to flip mode that is slower?
__label__0 The application would receive the decoded information and also, information about the barcode as the type etc...
__label__0 This gets even more painful when we work with client-application teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a loc-key loc-args contract.
__label__0 Other similar apps have this functionality, it would be quite useful to my workflow, at least.
__label__0 Thank you!

__label__0 The much promised bridge for the store called Centennial for class apps is still not in sight.
__label__0 In Windows 10 UWP, that's completely gone (you can use a Win Ph 8.1 Silverlight app to do it, but that's not UWP at all) We need to bring this_____ more
__label__0 It can only be seen on a dark background.
__label__0 That's ridiculous and I'm sick and tired… more

__label__0 Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout
__label__1 Since most of us don't have a trademark on app names this should be forced by the store (everybody will benefit with this Developers and Microsoft with a cleaner app store).
__label__0 I have created one new app and reserved it's name on that called fightofthelenegs, but when I try to create app packages, it is not showing in the package list in visual studio!!

__label__0 This would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want.
__label__0 At this moment the Launcher when launchs an URI it only supports http uris, it will be interesting that supports file:/// uris to send the launcher to open PDFs, words, and any file with just the URI, we do not need the StorageFile.

And in a BackgroundTask, the Launcher just does not launch websites, it is interesting to launch websites and reports in the computer in the morning saving time.
__label__0 * allow for no overflow
__label__0 Android has an excellent tutorial for learning the basics and creating an app, even if you're not a Java expert.

__label__0 Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?
__label__0 In this situation SuggestedStartLocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file the FileOpenPicker is opening in the PicturesLibrary.

__label__0 You can't use paste in the search bar/field and you can't use Feedly as a sharing option in other Android apps (Dolphin Browser, etc.).
__label__0 This scenario is described in this post: https://www.thomasclaudiushuber.com/2017/03/10/building-a-classic-tabbed-and-databound-desktop-app-with-uwp/

__label__0 I sincerely hope it makes a difference (Didn't know where else to give this suggestion as there is no live.com uservoice)
__label__0 RotatorTile's behavior is like an automated FlipView.
__label__1 We currently have apis to edit the user Libraries (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.storagelibrary.aspx) but it would be great if we could just have a unified UI for all apps.

That UI is already there (windows explorer) for classic windows apps.

A modern UI would be great.

One way to make that available to developper is throught launchers (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt210951.aspx) example: Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(new Uri(ms-libaries:music)); Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(new Uri(ms-libaries:videos));

__label__1 Would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store?
__label__0 all other messages

__label__1 Please fix the Problem in the WP8-SDK Fix Altitude Bug in GeoCoordinateWatcher and Geolocator when using in WP8.
__label__0 According to the description the Pushpin object should work as pop-up information window activated by pressing the map icon.
__label__0 I have tried the gReader and Press Android clients.
__label__0 I dont know is this is a Security norm from Microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection ?!

__label__0 Moreover, recently GeoTrust claimed us to cancel US registration (current one) and re-register as Russia.
__label__0 By far.
__label__0 As this can become very annoying I'm missing the option/ability to disable end-user notification when new apps has been assigned.
__label__0 (AF_UNIX ANCILLARY MMAP and many others ) within Docker.
__label__0 This also applies to apps written using PhoneGap and so will stifle the burgeoning HTML5 app development.
__label__0 In the current view, I can hardly see the contact number or anything that I would like to focus.
__label__0 This gave the MasterDetailsView the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it.
__label__0 Feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications.
__label__1 Could you please add SelectRanges(IEnumerabel<ItemIndexRange> itemIndexRanges) to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make SelectedRanges property is only { get; set; } to be able to replace existing selection ranges
__label__0 I'm presented with the Feedly app's splash screen along the way.
__label__0 Currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected… more
__label__0 It would be real help in increasing user experience
__label__0 4) Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.

Please create a possibility.
__label__0 With UWP, an AppointmentStore retrieved via RequestStoreAsync(AppointmentStoreAccessType.AppCalendarsReadWrite) will still return non-app calendars from GetAppointmentCalendarAsync.

This is different from the Windows Phone 8.1 behavior and inconsistent with FindAppointmentCalendarsAsync (which will not return those calendars).

This can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non-app calendar (until a Save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception).
__label__0 Keep tiles 4.
__label__0 Also phone has support but is painful to use why is it different to the PC version?
__label__1 Since Google Reader is going away on July 1st, I think it would be an awesome if Feedly sync's with TheOldReader, it would be a great partnership for both of you.
__label__0 However, sometimes I'd prefer to send an article to InstaPaper, Readability or Pocket AND STILL have it saved in Feedly.
__label__0 The Windows Store analytics API allows great access to acquisition data (both app and add-on acquisitions).
__label__1 Also if Cortana can read/reply messages from the phone why not link that API or process (not sure if those are the words needed for my idea) to the Messaging app that comes built-in on W10?
__label__0 Certain WP8 phones have wireless or inductive charging, and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers.

__label__0 So I won't sell my phone.
__label__0 My app contains a CalendarView component.
__label__0 At the same time other mobile phones working under the same operator have strong 4-5 bar signal.
__label__0 Currently if the user clicks the save button right after using the SIP, the data entered is not persisted to the object bound to the control.
__label__0 It does not always result in an error.
__label__0 Is it possible to use Google Auth to save to Pocket from Feedly on Android?
__label__0 Mouse sensors and other similar harware devices.

__label__0 Microphone sampling frequency is fixed.
__label__0 In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes visual programming animation software single/multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others.
__label__0 For example Linus Torvalds.
__label__1 An app for online clothes shopping so that we are able to buy clothes from our phones should be made
__label__0 There are some bugs in notification center.If there are so many notifications in notification center then it lags when i scroll it down.. i don't know that others are facing this problem or not but i think its a major issue...
__label__1 Maybe you can add an 'All Apps' option to the 'Page filter' of the reviews.
__label__0 Because on international keyboards if Right Alt is pressed then Left Control is also pressed?
__label__0 Is there anywhere I can find a copy and download it?
__label__0 Readers get access to contribution-only content.
__label__0 It is really annoying to remember every interesting site until I can use a desktop computer.
__label__0 This would also solve another requested issue where devs want to get visualization data.
__label__1 Allow us to query device information from a 100% native C++ application so we are not forced to use C#.
__label__0 There's no way to specifically highlight the paticular place that we're wanting to show to the user.
__label__0 Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit?
__label__0 That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code:
__label__1 Also need API for voice record with background agent.
__label__0 (I'd also be OK using a Xaml Path.)
__label__0 Currently you cannot create an Emitter unless you are using 48K Wave audio.
__label__0 The FutureAccessList has an issue.

__label__0 I've had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed
__label__0 This must be one of the most basic auto-corrects.
__label__1 I request we are able to have full customization capability.
__label__0 A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in UWP.
__label__1  - Individual CalendarMonthView control so that if you want to display standalone months you can (maybe you display a grid of 4 months etc)
__label__1 Create Kippt integration to allow sharing to Kippt.com
__label__0 While i was trying to generate the project from the App studio, it just hung.
__label__1 The other side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of its progress unless the platform offers capabilities such as SQL Server X-Event Windows Application Event Log or some form of notification.
__label__0 I've managed to reproduce it using the official MSDN sample and as it's hard to test/debug, I've published a video with the problem: https://youtu.be/_W9S7g-JCQQ If the name of the app is little longer and/or with space inside, then after the OS cancels the background player (not used for some time), it's not possible to reinitialize it by pressing UVC button - the IBacgroundTask.Run method is called twice and without UVC button pressed event.
__label__0 Not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than 1000 file access - why to give such a handicap for the whole platform?
__label__1 Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see, it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed.
__label__0 That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard-drive bloat issue.
__label__0 What else could be important is that I've set additional security code (so I've got two codes, first for SIM card and second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity).
__label__1 It would be great if the <Application Executable=launcher.exe> element or the <uap3:Extension Category=windows.appExecutionAlias> element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest.xml file.
__label__1 These page templates should be updated to use the medium-sized, semibold font by default for the title text.

__label__1 Bloggers/Authors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rss-feed and bank- or paypal-account at feedly.

__label__0 one keychain( Bluetooth chip inserted in a keychain for Dynamic Lock to pair) included with software purchase and the option to purchase multiple key-chains for each user.

__label__1 Bring back ability to copy/paste addresses from Bing search so people can text each other addresses to meet up at!
__label__0 Also there is no way to having different verbs on different file types which could be quite limiting.
__label__0 Plz plz unlock it.
__label__0 This is so ridiculous that windows update doesn't have any rule and there is no way (believe me I googled a lot) to allow it securely (without allowing whole svhost.exe) even spotify has a default rule!
__label__1 Keep in mind the limits: 100 Command elements in a command set; 10 ListenFor entries in a command; 50 total PhraseList elements; and 2000 total PhraseList items across all PhraseLists.
__label__0 That was a very good build.
__label__0 If larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text.

__label__0 When uploading screenshots, we are given the choice to upload one of the these sizes: 768 x 1280, 720 x 1280, or 480 x 800 pixels I would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in 1080x1920 pixel size.

__label__1 For older browser that do not fully support ES6 the code could be transpiled into ES5 by babeljs traceur etc.
__label__0 Also I noticed that in the Mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword.
__label__0 Currently, the Windows Phone SDK installs all the components within the SDK, including the emulator.
__label__0 It scanned my entire computer for certification (way outside the scope of building a UWP application).
__label__0 I have seen api recording and streaming and previewing the capture from the video.
__label__0 This can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non-app calendar (until a Save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception).
__label__0 The 'MethodName' property of the KnownTypeAttribute on type 'ObjectModel.Entities.BaseThing' is not currently supported.

__label__0 using category with filter to see for example all professional contact or all professional rendez-vous...
__label__0 In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one.
__label__0 Thereby, integrate WinRT apps with Office.
__label__0 The method would be useful for developers who must deal with diacritics in multilanguage apps.
__label__1 And virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group.
__label__1 Please un-hamstring Windows 10 and support Process Isolation for Containers.
__label__0 Giving us back the peak hours on mail sync will make the sync way better than on Iphone and on current WP75
__label__0 (Pages created with Wordpress allow this.)

__label__0 Which means that something went wrong.
__label__0 So if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it.
__label__1 However, if in article/title view, allow long press to bring up a menu.
__label__0 The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp)
__label__1 Since UMDF USB drivers are absolutely safe from harming the system thus guarding from penetrating the SP networks, it would be a good idea to allow 3rd party registered device driver developers to be able to develop UMDF signed drivers, submitted for testing and approval for such devices as I mentioned before.
__label__0 I'm using the TreeView of your official samples on https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView.

__label__0 This very much limits business type apps that can use resources or run apps while connected to a work network.
__label__0 Timer
__label__1 I believe that, instead of limiting the amount of certifications per user per day, the Marketplace should be a little better curated.
__label__0 Solution is to call this method in an override of onNavigated method.
__label__0 For instance, normally a stock price tile updates every 30 minutes via a background task, but if you tap it, the quote updates instantly.
__label__0 Otherwise AR scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices.

__label__0 and not calling SetDesiredBounds!
__label__1 It would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size can't fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around (similar to MSN news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications)
__label__0 This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience.
__label__0 For consistency sakes requesting same from all async awaitable(s).
__label__1 Please give that back.
__label__1 It might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly.
__label__0 A user of yMidi contacted me about this problem.

__label__0 This enables caching of and usage of offline maps

__label__0 I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size (width height) or position(x y) but the values of those attribute are all zero.
__label__0 If you request an offset for a location that is outside of the visible map portion, the returned point is not computed using the same Dpi than a location which lie inside of the visible portion of the map.

Currently, we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of map.ActualWidth and map.ActualHeight.

__label__0 I appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power, but if Microsoft believes in putting the user in control, then allow the user to enable access to persistent TCP connections on an app by app basis as Windows 8 allows.
__label__0 Like how Xamarin.Forms does it instead of… more
__label__1 Please implement style triggers for Windows Phone XAML (BAML?).
__label__0 Enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible, more open for users and developers
__label__0 Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially___ more
__label__0 But none of them let us upload anything from Office Hub.
__label__0 Windows is literally the only platform that restricts musicians in this way.
__label__0 _______________30_______________________________________栕___________________________________________________ ______栕___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________10_____________________________________________________________________________
__label__0 The problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content:
__label__1 It'd be great if the Slider control could have a TickOffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left-most edge of the control.
__label__0 I have built an app that targets Windows 8 and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on Windows 8.
__label__0 In the App Dev archive the photos are 700x700.
__label__0 iOS has this implemented in their store and I believe it works great.
__label__0 Because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available.
__label__0 oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites.
__label__0 App is in store with current policies at that time, there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff.
__label__0 Tango is a nice app BUT it is not handy to allways have it running in the background and to have a separate contact list in the application which is an exact duplicate of the contact list in the people hub.
__label__0 I'm looking to use ECDH key agreement in an universal windows app but I can't find a way to do so.
__label__0 Both Apple and Google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role, who has no access to sales/revenue reports.
__label__0 You can add an image but you cant remove it.
__label__0 Player: Your app is activated one time.
__label__1 Microsoft should re-enable the Windows Bridge for Android.
__label__0 2) GetPositionAsync() and GetGeopositionAsync(TimeSpan, TimeSpan) regularly never return.
__label__0 Yes I know why it isn't but looking at my code nearly every instance is set to OneWay or TwoWay anyway.
__label__0 I've been working on an LOB for my field of engineering (civil/structural).
__label__0 Select Delete.
__label__1 It would be even better if I could have an API that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failure/retransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment.
__label__0 Now with WIndows Phone 8.1 the app ALWAYS has to open.
__label__1 it would be so much easier just to have a context-menu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser.
__label__0 I keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration, but can't find it anywhere.
__label__0 The build in Music + Video app's fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice, but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had to be plugged in to enable the FM radio.
__label__1 One possibility: Instead of having a top charts style listing, where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere, create a new form of distribution, where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace.
__label__0 I use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on PC.
__label__0 In browser session storage we do not have any mechanism to hold those references or even local storage cannot hold window object references.
__label__0 I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.
__label__0  A new version fails the certification process with “10.4.2 App Crash or Freeze”
__label__0 Together, this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the Marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices.
__label__1 My suggestion is that Microsoft create an Cordova AdControl and Mediation plugin.
__label__0 Even after I log out of feedly.
__label__0 so that we can trigger our application on such events.
__label__0 I see no reason why they wouldn't because I know they transferred over a bunch of Google Reader feeds but they aren't doing what feedly is.
__label__0 In addition the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms.
__label__1 Net native tools would be great.
__label__1 Bing music search should add the ability to learn about the artist and to get the song lyrics for the song it hears.
__label__1 I think it should have been thought more to be like BB10 Hub.
__label__0 In that app If we click Continue Reading button it will show all the devices connected to this device.
__label__0 In order to take the screenshot it takes 2 mouse clicks and about half a second.
__label__0 When you use full screen mode StatusBar.ShowAsync doesn't work.
__label__0 1) This limit is not in the [EmailMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.email.emailmessage) documentation.
__label__1 The emulator should include a treeview control to display a live view of: Page States App State IsolatedStorageSettings IsolatedStorageFile(s) The ideal would include some kind of object drill down in the style of Mole for WPF, but even ToStrings would work.
__label__1 New HTTP Server and HttpListener APIs should be added that surface the failures and request queue state.
__label__0 BatterySaver controls are buried fairly deep in the Settings menu.
__label__0 Latter uses new features of Windows 10 and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from Windows Phone 8.1 users.
__label__0 When we get the pure image data without image file head info we don‘t want to chang the pure data.
__label__1 Suggestion: If the returned StorageFile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the FileSavePicker could do it with a read-only property or method after the user confirmed the file.
__label__1 i.e. do that google reader/feedly does for RSS, but with twitter.... or facebook... or pinterest
__label__0 When you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop->Debug.
__label__0 In some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class.
__label__0 The SuggestedStartLocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker.
__label__1 It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons.
__label__0 For example, if you want to retrieve gelolocations frequently in the background.
__label__1 So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs.
__label__0 When Skype replaces Messenger, don't forget wp7 users...background push messaging
__label__0 Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn't allow unsafe code, enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the PC.
__label__0 If I categorize my game as a game in the manifest it doesn't appear on the lock screen notifications even though I implement all requirements.
__label__0 I'm aware that the Background Transfer Service is available, but there are cases where this is not usable, because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage.
__label__0 Enable to send tweets within an app by showing a TwitterComposeTask.
__label__1 The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification.
__label__0 The current support for Bluetooth LE in Win10 Creators Update does not allow publishing of an Eddystone beacon ( https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone ) because the api reserves the use of many data section types.
__label__0 Microsoft has a RSS Platform for a common store of RSS feeds across IE and Outlook.
__label__0 After a little while, developer may think that, anyway they are not going thru, what's the point in spending time here.
__label__0 then dismiss keyboard.
__label__0 What is the problem?
__label__0 And offers advanced timing and perfect synchronization between animations and sound effects, something very rare even in closed and proprietary software animation formats.
__label__0 The CommandBar in the Page.TopAppBar has a dark MenuFlyoutPresenter Background brush.
__label__0 Let normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs.
__label__0 I have the same core code running on the above platforms but to do it on WP7.1 I will have to rewrite!
__label__0 depends on connections and permits (their are not just one profile related posts).	 
__label__0 This was not happening before on Windows 10 1709 or earlier.
__label__0 Perhaps a double-tap opens the app like they do now.
__label__0 This would surely make the integration with Direct2D content much easier.
__label__0 the hamburger button is on the side of the back button.
__label__0 In VS2015 (and maybe in 2017) the compiler raised a warning (that we missed) that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the UWP toolchain.
__label__0 i dont want use UAC, is a security risk.
__label__0 One can read more here: http://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/post/2012/01/06/Framework-Exceptions-in-Windows-Phone.aspx
__label__0 With the PhoneToolkit I can Instantiate polygons or other UI with an template that I can give to my more artistic gifted friends for making my map symbols stylish.
__label__0 I don't for how long but I noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de Windows app store seacchresults.
__label__1 Add 2 more properties for gridviews controls.
__label__0 It looks as if the return value of... Windows.System.Power.EnergySaverStatus ...is always 1, i.e. Off.

Regardless of a threshold set in the energy saver settings.

Looks like a bug.

I'm using a Lumia 620 device with Windows 10 Mobile Build 10586.11.

Could someone please have a look into this Thanks!
__label__0 It would be much like the Skype for desktop's small call window that comes up when you are in a call.
__label__0 I'm using the Microsoft example found here:
__label__1 week passed after i published my app on Windows mobile store, and the link to the app in the store still isn't working.

I also published versions for Android and iOS.

Android = 3 hours till link is working.

Apple = 16 hours.

Windows Store= over a week ?????!!!!!!

You have much to improve, microsoft.
__label__1 Since we are passing a string via the x:Bind attribute to some UI controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a ReadonlySpan<T> so we avoid allocations.
__label__0 If you create a ListView in an HTML UWP app you can't invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen.
__label__0 i will lost all my games.I really be happy if i can download them from a virtual saving platform to my new device,or for a technical problem i have to reboot my phone,i would like to have those games back without download it again
__label__0 I don’t know what the component should look like.
__label__0 I tried to play the same remote video via WIFI and iPhone 4 always win Nokia Lumia 920.
__label__0 In the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store(or if exist, it is really well hidden).
__label__0 We have to provide different versions of our client application at the same time as converted app in the store.
__label__0 RouteQuery uses online service to calculate the route.
__label__0 However, these are just bigger ad formats and not the interstitials we know from other ad networks.
__label__0 It is impossible to manage even a hanging indent because Paragraph lacks Margin and TextIndent properties.
__label__1 Or at least make the browser extension useful (Firefox add-on has no use...)
__label__0 We could minimize or maximize the pictures but now we can only maximize.
__label__1 so we need aupport for such feature in XAML Code like in SilverLight 5
__label__0 I have reported sales information from many other sources.
__label__0 But there are still times when you want to install some things.
__label__0 DownloadOperation (BackgroundTransfer API) restarts from 0 when resumed after being paused at 100% (progress.bytesReceived == progress.totalBytesToReceive and startAsync task hasn't completed).
__label__0 Unfortunately, it is also bug-infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in 2015.
__label__0 My PC becomes unresponsive.
__label__0 import videos.
__label__1 Hi - you really need to fix the Xbox App store.
__label__0 I can't find any way to configure Pocket to use Google Auth.
__label__1 Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines.
__label__0 It will be more quickly and easier.
__label__1 Can you create a connection between Google Alerts and Feedly, so that when I update a feed in Google Alerts, the change will be picked up by Feedly.
__label__0  // We're not able to add this folder
__label__0 But all will not do it.
__label__0 Yes, your are right, too similar to Her, the movie.
__label__0 What are the things went wrong, rather than saying your app failing on 2.11 (it's generic message) will be no use, as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies.
__label__0 I would have expected that this would be the way to start but there is no ECDH possible in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.security.cryptography.core.asymmetricalgorithmnames
__label__0 We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons we've added.
__label__0 Inexplicably, the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly 10 years ago.
__label__0 The advantage of XAML to natively support SVG with SMIL is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver SVGs to you.
__label__0 You can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the RFC.
__label__0 However, currently no WP8 platform component seems to support SSL certificate pinning.
__label__1 Like many others, I want to add some Twitter feeds as RSS feeds.
__label__0 I've tested this on newest W10 build, both on emulator and device.
__label__0 I use BeyondPod on my Android phone and it supported integration of sorts with Feedly.
__label__0 So no contents of MyApp and no KnownFolderDump.exe.
__label__1 I want to be able to refund a purchase that a customer made - both in-app products and paid downloads.
__label__0 It shows up in the store as JL Planner.
__label__0 It's not fair to the developer that ads can sometimes start days or weeks after the app is published.
__label__0 I've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).
__label__1 It would eliminate the need for an add-on to IE as people can use the native button to have their feeds pulled into Feedly.
__label__1 Remove the 10 recipient cap on App generated SMS messages.
__label__0 It would save us a lot of time.
__label__0 The fact that we have to go through C++ to exploit such key resources as DX, D2D, DrawingSurfaces in W8, WPF, WP8 is _NOT_ acceptable.
__label__0 The ability to change to audio route for the MediaLibrary would also be great.
__label__0 vorrei collegarmi ad internet da pc con il mio windows phone
__label__0 But if the device is disconnected from any network then the waiting time between SpeechRecognizer StateChanged starts “SoundEnded” and the ResultGenerated event is invoked is very small less than 10ms!
__label__0 The same code ran on an emulator does not results in this bump.
__label__0 It is available on the PC though.
__label__0 so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries.
__label__0 You Recently added function and allowed us to save an article to; Evernote , that's great !	
__label__0 A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.
__label__0 Currently any UWP developer is forced to use C++ for accessing DirectX features or rely on third party support like SharpDX or Unity3D for those features.
__label__1 I would like the ability in XAML to conditionally have my XAML output be compile with flags like you can currently with c#.
__label__0 Windows 10 64-bit Each window does not have Max/Min buttons at the upper left hand corner for user functionality.
__label__0 We're still missing the 1080p and 6 sizes
__label__0 ie9mobile does not do this :(
__label__0 As an early adopter of the platform I have a number of test apps and/or games.
__label__0 We have tried with ExtendedJsonData property but the add-on array is empty too.
__label__1 Your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit.
__label__1 How about giving Feedly compatibility with If This Then That?
__label__0 Ability to hide pictures from picture gallery and unhide them ie file manager's Without app.
__label__0 xmpp is not not supported in windows phone 7.0 since it dose not support socket.
__label__0 The reason I got into this is because I figured If any company could do it Microsoft could and then I find out that I can't.
__label__0 When porting this app to Windows Phone 8.1, the sound is flickering and its components are stack overflow-ing.
__label__0 Note, that if you have a Store account, the apps from that side will not transfer.
__label__1 Promote Feedly by having that version of NewsRob being re- branded with Feedly logo.
__label__0 We have always been aware of the guidance that a MapIcon is not guaranteed to be displayed but it's never been a problem.
__label__0 Of course Win32 Apps and UWP Apps can use Goggle IME.
__label__0 APIs do not support the configuration of the window background colour.

This means that if, like Groove (Music), an app uses a non-white background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size.
__label__1 The look and content of the items should of course be customizable.
__label__0 Windows Store Policy for Adult Content
__label__0 Currently this is not possible because when trying to add custom Headers to the content using the below code: HttpMultipartContent mpContent = new HttpMultipartContent(); mpContent.Headers.Add(Content-Transfer-Encoding, 8bit); we first check to see if the headers which are trying to be added are well known headers.
__label__0 Namely the file that was replaced.
__label__0 I don't see this limitation documentated anywhere (but I might have missed it).
__label__0 On Android and iPhone it's fine, I'm even take some volume down on Android as it's too loud.
__label__0 After installing the GDR3 dev preview on my Lumia 920, there have been instances where my phone will restart after trying to open an app or save a contact.
__label__1 As an app developer working with custom Bluetooth devices, I need to be able to communicate with them in an unpaired scenario.
__label__0 I hope you get the point !!
__label__0 I've been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart.
__label__0 On Android you place it directly in the markup*.
__label__0 This would be good in Windows 8 too.
__label__0 Sometimes phone is getting stucked while unlocking phone on my HTC 8S.
__label__0 I understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools.
__label__1 I'm sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration.
__label__1 It would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a UWP BitmapImage (which can be significant for large images).
__label__0 Start typing something in the search tab and try to scroll to the bottom most element while the inputpane is open you cant see the last element.
__label__0 The unknown error also happens on build 17713 and I'm curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release?
__label__0 The previous 5 app are: - old - not updated - with less reviews - low rating How bizview can not be first in all regions?
__label__1 Would be nice if you could drag your file from the Project Tree over to a Xaml property requiring an ms-appx:/// path and it would expand to an ms-appx:/// path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem?
__label__1 At least for Air France (i did not test it for other companies), the picture send by SMS are not compatible with WP7 ... it should be great to be able to open it
__label__0 Making it possible to change iso in Video mode.
__label__1 I would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also, or may be give an advance search option, where people can tell where the word should be searched.
__label__0 If it is not intended why then is… more
__label__0 There must be a way to handle this kind of problem, like statistics on how many times an app was started, or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps.
__label__0 Starting a project for a UWP is really hard.
__label__0 There appears to be a current bug with the android app and the Evernote integration.	
__label__0 The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords.
__label__0 Currently I have to save a MP3 stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP.
__label__0 At the beggining of an audio, a bump is heard.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to assign a (compiled) binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors.
__label__0 This notification, in my opinion, will make WinPho stills a different OS from Android and iOS.
__label__1 Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.
__label__0 This violates developer expectations.
__label__0 And the focus s and flash you can change it.
__label__0 Some people may sell their apps to others.
__label__0 Currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history (after '.. Apps updated' was selected in notification center): 1 expand menu bar, 2 select downloads, 3 swipe to history:
__label__1 At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version.
__label__1 give me ONE place to consume everything, but only see it once (unless I save it). 
__label__0 Is there any fix for this problem?
__label__1 It could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a Power BI chart inside a UWP application easily with a Control or by code.
__label__0 But why not let us flip the tile instead (Note: The mail tile would *always* open the app.)
__label__0 Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue.
__label__0 My company likes WP7, but the nonexistence of visual voice-mail is stopping a switch from the iPhone.
__label__0 Note: the dev center not showing delete option for this particular name.
__label__1 It would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app.
__label__0 Like thousands of other developers I have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies.
__label__1 After registration, unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author.
__label__0 Ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see.
__label__0 It could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app Marketplace.
__label__0 4.- Check for pinned ActiveTiles (not modify them, just check if an ApplicationID primary or secondary tile is already pinned)
__label__0 We can see the issue by playing youtube video or play video in MetroTube, Tube Pro app.
__label__1 Use it a lot with IoT gadgets and android, would love to change the android device to a windows phone device and use c#.
__label__0 We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.
__label__0 It's so annoying!!
__label__0 If I'm already connected, the bot could write headlines (with links) to me upon receipt of the news in my rss-subscription.
__label__0 There are several certification requirements from Microsoft that are impossible to test without a physical Windows Phone device.
__label__0 As a musician I often get mp3's attached in e-mails when we're in the process of recording, mixing and editing music.
__label__0 I launch this complaint on behalf of others and in good faith.
__label__0 Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly.
__label__1 Introduce functionality so that MAC address can be obtained programmatically.
__label__0 I understand that a lot of people who choose to have links open in Chrome may not like it, but I really liked having links be added to my Chrome history while still feeling like I was in the Feedly app.
__label__0 In an ideal world I should be able to invoke a task and than optionally send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it.
__label__0 a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event.
__label__0 How can we ensure registration is complete for the COM server without adding regsvr32 command in post build and setting linker value for “Register Output” to false.
__label__0 I just my dev center account just like facebook and watch for notifications.
__label__0 With the two stores combining, can we bring this to Windows Phone?
__label__0 However, since the original account is tied to my Microsoft Id (which is used everywhere else!)
__label__0 gives feedly an additional revenue model.
__label__0 The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel  you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields  visualizations and animations.
__label__0 Especially if there are deadlines to fulfill, it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified.
__label__0 Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support.
__label__0 and user may not understand how to open some type of files.
__label__0 However, it NEVER gets good visibility because it isn't the best, which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions.
__label__0 Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.
__label__0 When my code checks for the property AddOnLicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add-on.
__label__1 It could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a Power BI chart inside a UWP application easily with a Control or by code.
__label__0 Not able to retrieve MAC address of device.
__label__0 Initially if I have rtf text in first line and then after adding bullets to the same line the bullets does not appears in same color font and font family.
__label__1 I wish that garbage collection was optional for C# UWP apps.
__label__1 It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.
__label__0 I recently submitted an app, but the process hung when I clicked Submit.
__label__0 This will stay until the parent types in their password.
__label__0 (for side loading you need to install the *.cer file contained in the AppPackages/AppName*version*_Test folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots) OK. Something must be wrong with the uploaded “.appxupload ” package.
__label__0 Come on guys, Twitter is winning the battle for far!!!!!
__label__0 I do not wish to leave it out there.
__label__1 * Implicit DataTemplates (not really an issue of the Pivot but would be great to have these.)
__label__0 A developer should be able to run an emulator instance outside of the developer's environment, and be able to connect/deploy/debug into that remote VM.
__label__0 The same goes for the app uploading itself, a larger timeout is there, but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed, which not everyone has.
__label__0 Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me?
__label__0 When will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone?
__label__0 I generate a majority of my Google Reader RSS content from manually set up Google Alerts (by setting up Google keyword searches and selecting Deliver to: Google Reader).
__label__0 Today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user.
__label__0 Currently windows phone does not allow to call a webservice from these events.
__label__0 It does not make a sense when the large (multimedia) files have to be transferred (You first have to transfer them up to Skydrive and then - download to phone).
__label__0 I really really loved the Now Playing Screen on the Zune HD (Like the current Zune Software) with information and stuff moving over the artist background, which panned.
__label__0 Regards,
__label__0 Those apps get ranked high in the listings and take away the place of the few others that actually are good.
__label__0 This control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in UWP.
__label__0 THX.
__label__1 Core should be reserves for micro systems such as the raspberry pi.
__label__0 We can see the issue by playing youtube video or play video in MetroTube, Tube Pro app.
__label__0 First look at: smoedjn.deviantart.com/art/lumia-800-xb-slide-272670125
__label__0 With service issue I mean devcenter backend is down or doesn't work properly in some ways.
__label__0 Currently it is supported on Windows Phone only.
__label__0 The Oauth screen is popping up and hanging,
__label__0 A lot of the RSS feeds I read force you to go to the full site to read the full article.
__label__0 I was logging in using my google credentials.
__label__0 An essential and very beneficial feature, that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user.

Example, An app, that allows users to select a time i.e; Tomorrow 10,30 AM to do something.
__label__0 I'm not sure I can think of a reason that any certification is needed for these; they're merely a price, key, and type.
__label__0 At the moment there is no easy way to prevent a one-way binding from clearing when a DependencyProperty is set to a new value.
__label__0 Music will then continue to play once you respond to the notification.
__label__0 I have apps I would like to transfer (which had IAPs) but I cannot do___ more
__label__0 That is if they have an API for it.
__label__0 Same code on machine with anniversary update portal shows the string message in payload.
__label__1 However, there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.
__label__0 I dont wanna see all of them and it should fall in that contacts conversation.
__label__0 Cheers!
__label__0 This leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems.
__label__0 all app made by Edutainment 4u)Those are rubbish!!
__label__0 My wifi is terrible after 8.1 update.
__label__0 Buffer overrun while writing to 'newACL': the writable size is 'aclSize' bytes but '8' bytes might be written.
__label__0 Lastly, you can enter a full stop and a space by hitting space twice, like this.
__label__1 If would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a Popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario (like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered).
__label__0 When dropping appx bundles onto the drop target the page takes a long time to respond.
__label__1 So please allow UWP apps without .NET Native!
__label__0 I would gladly become a Feedly Pro subscriber if you offered something comparable.
__label__1 I would like to try this out -- making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples.
__label__0 No info regarding last update.

__label__0 When I save an article to Evernote, the resulting note is the text and images, but not what the webpage looks like.	
__label__0 Currently, Microsoft.Phone.Info.DeviceStatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from C# project making it a round way about to include this project in C++ ( managed code).
__label__0 I made a UWP app with a ListView (using KeepLastItemInView).
__label__0 Currently we can only choose safari and chrome in options.
__label__0 So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process!
__label__0 Expected behavior when I follow one of the links, find it interesting and click the Pocket icon, is to save the clicked-through article.
__label__0 This is experienced on a Nokia Lumia 800, OS version: 7.10.8107.79
__label__0 My Nokia 928 screen was unresponsive along with the 3 screen buttons.

__label__0 ApplicationView.SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead.
__label__1 You should be able to select a default application for certain functions.
__label__0 I just reinstalled Firefox on a new machine and I can't login to Feedly via Google authentication.
__label__0 Saw the same issue with client app in PackagedComServer sample with those 2 settings changed.
__label__0 Because the page doesn't change to reflect the drop operation was successful I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth.
__label__0 Since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my Windows Phone 7 app, I do not consider this off topic.
__label__1 A toolbar stacks items from left-to-right and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models
__label__0 These properties will allow developers to introduce many useful features such as Auto playlists, and it'll also help xbox team to bring back Recently Added feature.
__label__1 It would be very useful to add this feature into Hosted Web Apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a Hosted Web App.
__label__0 Some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason.
__label__1 I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers.
__label__0 LocalizationString) that will harness the Bing Translator API at the time of download by lazy translating the text into the device's local language and saving the translation dictionary of that app for future downloads of that locality or retrieve the existing copy of the app in that locality.

__label__0 Force re-start require.
__label__0 I'm a bit surprise by the Action Center.
__label__1 As a developer we should be able to create subusers who has no access to sales data, kind of release manager role we can assign to them.

Currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps, easily know the revenue earned.
__label__0 if I catch a generic Exception, obtain this exception message: Object reference not set to an istance of an object in row : LiveLoginResult result = await authClient.LoginAsync(new string[] { wl.signin, wl.skydrive }); but authClient is not null.

__label__0 Because of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app, I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well.
__label__0 It worked in IE11 then.
__label__0 Negative reviews are bad, especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users.

Similarly to iOS, please display current app version and also show the app version of the user reviews in the store.
__label__0 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ----- ___ChevronWP7______6______coming soon________________________________________________
__label__0 In fact I wonder why MS does not support this FUNDAMENTAL feature while Android and iOS already does.
__label__0 This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish/must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions.
__label__0 To get back to feedly, I have to back out or go into recent apps.
__label__0 The closest solution to this I have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails (and they support rss feeds) but they also strip out all images/attachments/etc and generate plain text feeds, so this isn't a good solution.
__label__0 However, the downside of that would be that you couldn't place this widget in a homescreen folder.
__label__0 I'm using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions.
__label__1 Why not add a setting to the inner circle that allows me to turn off the ringtone and let it vibrate only.
__label__0 It seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers.
__label__0 _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Git___Subversion_______________Eclipse___NetBeans____________IDE_________________________________________Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone_______________________________________________________________
__label__1 I would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization.
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction.
__label__1 Can Microsoft Corporation make a similar app, please?
__label__0 Was looking for some type of function of that.
__label__1 What would be really helpful is to provide an event (maybe something like DirectManipulationCompleting) that would fire as soon as the pointer is released (e.g.
__label__0 So each morning I start my day with my Inbox, Google Calendar, and Google Reader each in their own tab, right there together in one app.
__label__0 When the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the… more
__label__0 Following data would be great:
__label__1 Provide semantic animations like fadeIn fadeout Crossfade etc.
__label__1 Please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby NFC tag is recognized.
__label__1 it would be great to be able to bind / invoke scripts inside a WebView from a ViewModel (like binding a URL to a Property).
__label__1 This is not really completely UWP related but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows 10 versions for testing purposes as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version.
__label__0 Will you be making that an additional option along side open directly in browser?
__label__0 We've still useless applications flooding the Marketplace, and there are no signs of it slowing.
__label__0 Imagine having an installed app do___ more
__label__1 At some point can we get Google Keep integration to go along side Pocket?
__label__0 So audio and video works but subtitles don't work.
__label__1 However it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in Visual Studio.
__label__0 The specified wildcard character pattern is not valid: [.exe
__label__0 TypeConverter is helpful because it allows the author of a type to provide intrinsic support for determining to/from which types a type may be converted and actually converting between types - most typically for converting to/from string but other types as well.
__label__0 It's been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others.
__label__0 But on both Windows Phone 8 emulator and device (Nokia Lumia 920), there are 2 problems: - DownloadProgress property often returned 1.0 right after video if opened.
__label__0 If you open the app in the US Windows Phone Store, it shows only 1 rating with 1 star.
__label__0 You can retweet and answer Tweets but You cant favorite
__label__0 This is the most important feature lacking in WP8.
__label__0 But I've found that windows phone 8.1 file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist.
__label__0 That was a very good build.
__label__0 This is especially limiting when browsing DLCs for games without any screenshots.
__label__0 The WebBrowser control performs very poorly to scrolling and html content inside 3rd party apps whereas the same page when opened inside the browser works fine.
__label__0 You can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically.

__label__0 It works fine with Chrome & IE but when I click the Login link in Firefox nothing happens.
__label__0 I know you can set a preference to save an article to a read later service instead of saving it to Feedly, but I like Feedly's save feature within the apps.	
__label__1 A thing that would be increbible is that your phone make a sound when you whistle or Clap hands a certain pattern ( wich could be preseted by the phone owner ) so when you can't find your phone and you dont have a buddy around to text you, you can find it!
__label__0 Previously it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows' style (As mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically) but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP I am left without this functionality.0
__label__0 Now it doesn't work the same way.
__label__0 If a user wants an application to host content, whether it be 1GB of music or 1GB of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative.
__label__0 [CDATA[ history.forward(); ]]></script> </menuItem> </menuItems> <events> <event name=onload> <script><!
__label__1 It would be nice to have an attached property for ScrollViewer to set middle click scrolling.
__label__0 I love being able to share short text messages quickly by ShareStatusTask.
__label__0 The ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free.
__label__0 Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.
__label__1 Please expose Undo/Redo functions on the TextBox control so that we can trigger it programatically.
__label__1 It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input.
__label__0 Maybe I'm missing something, but this API seems to be broken.
__label__0 SMIL is the THE standard format for animations, used both for the Web as part of SVG: http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL/ http://codepen.io/search?q=smil&limit=all&depth=everything&show_forks=false _____ and as the official OpenDocument format for animations and graphic effects: http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1416228_253892949 Currently you cannot include SMIL and SVG animated images in XAML, and in IE you need to use a polyfill based on the web animation standard to run SMIL animations.

__label__1 At least you can give Students an option (on DreamSparks) to install Hyper-V on their regular OS.
__label__0 (Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes... just without tiling :'( )
__label__1 It would allow the app/developer to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off--with the app running and at a specific position in the app.
__label__0 Instead of making a new app update immediately available to everyone, allow control in Dev Center to release to a percentage of users.

This allows developer to obtain metrics and feedback before opening the floodgates and reverting to previous version if necessary.
__label__0 best regards and a happy new year Karsten Klein from Germany the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.

__label__0 I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom/top of the ListView.
__label__0 Are we going to see it eventually?
__label__0 But with the new store ranking algorithm, this search produces search results where the following all appear higher up than my app: - Apps with average 2* reviews (even 1.5* in one case) - Apps that have not been updated since 2013 - Apps that last received a review in 2014 - Apps that crash on launch - Apps that are not ebook readers This is just_____ more
__label__0 Normal mouses are working fine but 3D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from 3D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC.

__label__0 I then used SharpDx for my app.
__label__1 In addition to the existing profiler tool, a network activity profiler should be given so that we can analyse network activities that are happening, potentially helping in troubleshooting cases wheter network activites are becoming bottleneck for app responsiveness.
__label__0 My hypothesis- what people read is important for a prospective employer.
__label__0 I am not going to download multiple GBs of **** that I will never use to fix a memory leak.
__label__0 Currently MultiSelectModel does not work as documented:
__label__0 Some users certainly will find this useful.

__label__0 3rd part can then Develop application that has the ability to set phone to mute/vibrate based on location.
__label__1 I want to be able to just log into Feedly and not have it log me out if I log out of Google.
__label__0 However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.
__label__0 At home I use wifi.
__label__0 The tile does not show current date and events.
__label__1 It would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary/word list/constraint as we can already with Speech recognition as it was possible in the old Microsoft.Ink API:
__label__0 The older tooling (AppDeployCmd.exe) would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them (though it's support for devices left a lot to be desired).
__label__1 Please add full LDAP-Support (Query Read Write).
__label__0 3) In general the API is poorly designed.
__label__1 If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and___ more
__label__0 You can now only see the console (but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn't show errors), not even the DOM.
__label__0 Sure profiles would attract many Nokia users to WP products.
__label__0 WinRT is littered with Async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases.
__label__0 Like for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in 3D make it better in Mixed reality
__label__0 When you apply new policies on already existing, especially if it is related to name, all the existing credibility and market is lost.
__label__0 Unfortunately, that task or access does not exist.
__label__0 And yes I've tried different headphones and even different phones to test my operator connection quality.
__label__1 I also think there;s something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify 10 lines height it should say 10 lines in height and not expand box.... it should just beep when you get to the end of the 10 lines... of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the 10 lines... but i'll leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property... to make it work the way people want it to work....
__label__0 Bring famous mock frameworks to UWP!

__label__0 We can't determine if the add-on is active and neither the expiration date.
__label__0 Unfortunately if a task is launched via this TimeTrigger but appears idle to the Operating System then it is SUSPENDED.
__label__0 4 screenshots in two languages turns into 24 screenshots, which is totally nuts.
__label__0 This should be available both in WinRT and Silverlight applications.
__label__1 However to don't sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode D3D->SetExceptionMode(D3D11_RAISE_FLAG_DRIVER_INTERNAL_ERROR) and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning: writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results

__label__1 Would be really helpful to have FindAncestor API added just like in Silverlight 5 and WPF.
__label__1 If you wont let me change the country, at least let me close my account and recreate it!
__label__0 However, hacking a hanging indent is not the real goal - general support for bulleting.
__label__0 Though Blend has this template.
__label__0 emailcomposetask must have html support.
__label__1 Add support for Office to directly send presentation to wireless projector.
__label__0 Potential scenarios: - Developer doesn't have SLAT on their machine and wants to run the VM on a SLAT capable machine/server - Developer is running their dev environment in a virtual environment (e.g., local Hyper-V, remote Hyper-V, Parallels) and wants to run the emulator in another child VM on the same physical host they are running on (since she can't run a VM inside of a VM) - The ability to run a dev environment fully remote A developer should be able to run an emulator instance outside of the developer's environment, and be able to connect/deploy/debug into that remote VM.
__label__1 Its getting annoying.Please fix this.
__label__0 When entering address details for a contact the address details are split into different fields anyway so one would expect to be able to access them individually from the result an AddressChooserTask as well.
__label__1 That's why I'm suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers.
__label__1 And for the consistency of the UI design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button.
__label__1 It would be very useful if you allow external devices (e.g through Bluetooth) to control the running audio/video on the phone.
__label__0 However street and house number are included correctly in the FormattedAddress property.
__label__0 And unbelievably they are doing exactly that.
__label__0 So far this is the best feed reader I've tried.

__label__0 For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare, UL, ULC, Calypso, Desfire, maybe even more) I've read that for WP8.1 the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific NFC chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices.

__label__0 Open the customization of the live tile to have a possibility to control the volume of the phone and other thing.

__label__1 To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.

__label__0 When using classic Win32 MessageBox() API, the spawned dialog allows you to copy its content (using Ctrl+C).

__label__0 There is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without Direct2D or slow manual composition inside Canvas control.
__label__1 Right now, it's unnecessarily hard to change the color of a pressed toggle button.

It would be a lot more convenient to have a simple property to set the pressed togglebutton color, similar to how you set the background color of a control.

__label__0 This is insecure because I cannot verify that I am not phished and that I am talking directly to Google.

__label__0 I checked it a few times.
__label__0 What would I do?
__label__0 Lastly, app submission testing would ensure that the app plays nicely in what it offers.
__label__0 Right now app titles of more than just a dozen characters or so just get clipped in many places in the phone ui: the marketplace app list, the installed apps list, and inside of pinned tiles.

__label__0 Thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else, I changed the name slightly.
__label__0 This issue has been many times on stack overflow but its still answered.
__label__1 Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden.
__label__0 Parents would pay for application that would have the ability to change ringer and notification events based on geolocation.
__label__0 If the information is available from a browser, it should be available to an app.
__label__1 When playing a video using XAML MediaElement the cursor should hide automatically after some seconds.
__label__1 Please provide access for fm radio api's in wp8 and also the ability to change the audio route as currently the built in fm radio is capable of.
__label__0 The current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using Live Bookmarks anymore.
__label__0 You're building on a TreeView-control as your backlog on https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/platform shows.
__label__1 Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store.
__label__0 Right now, there's no easy way to automate their download and parsing.
__label__1 Please add the support of Audio Effects (e.g. Equalizer etc.) to the BackgroundMediaPlayer API.
__label__0 Note you cannot see files/images attached to the item
__label__0 Second, why don't work with metro style on FB app?
__label__1 I'd like to connect articles with items in my calendar.
__label__0 I understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools.
__label__0 My two cents.
__label__0 So that i can manage the phone, send messages, manage apps, account, settings and so on.
__label__0 Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!
__label__1 Please allow to change country !
__label__0 Some apps can work intensively in background, for example it maybe video converting, online financial data processing and more.


__label__1 It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage, or similar.
__label__1 Further I think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be Font-Icons so that when you click Download New Font its going to search nuget for this Font-Icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular...
__label__1 We are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden
__label__1 Better support for Commands for all controls, allowing to bind a Command in the ViewModel to any event from a supported control in XAML, without having to use third party tools such as MVVM Light.
__label__1 I would like to see better integration with Google services across the board, specifically GMail, Google+, and Google Drive.
__label__0 Adding visbility to the battery mAh would then allow battery health apps, charger comparisons, and inductive charger efficiency (or inneficiency).
__label__1 Allow developers to alter/edit an applications metadata, including description, images/graphics, pricing and keywords etc... once the app is published without resubmitting.
__label__0 Unfortunately we are not able to set the prices in both marketplace same way.
__label__0 As an app seller, I have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while.
__label__0 Example, An app, that allows users to select a time i.e; Tomorrow 10,30 AM to do something.
__label__0 However, the phone versions of the controls do not provide validation templates.
__label__0 I can add my Tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if I want to like them, I have to open the page in another browser window.
__label__0 A small number of non-UWP desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern/UWP environment.
__label__0 Windows 10 has a great feedback system.
__label__0 We have the app on all of the other stores using the same description and keywords and our app shows up with most words that have anything to do with financial planning, such as finance, financial, retirement, etc.
__label__0 (Note that this is not ECDSA; the use of elliptic curve keys in a signature mode)
__label__0 The current status only seems to show ‘In Progress’ if the app has never been put in the store before.
__label__0 The existing color picker have a very long height.
__label__0 We get an answer back and know how devices are in the network.
__label__0 Now I know why it was not working and I want to make my knowledge public.
__label__0 Sina weibo is a service like twitter in China(It has biggest market share).	
__label__1 Have the app available in the for Lion OSX in the app store.
__label__0 On other systems is works as expected.
__label__1 In Windows 10 UWP, that's completely gone (you can use a Win Ph 8.1 Silverlight app to do it, but that's not UWP at all) We need to bring this functionality over to UWP, especially since the OneDrive space was disastrously cut in October 2015, and now users will want a different free service on to which to upload pics.
__label__1 As a Windows app consumer, I want to be able to search for apps by functionality, so that I can find and download an app that will help me perform the task I want to carry out.
__label__1 Another even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an open with option in the built-in photos app.
__label__0 So if I click on a device it will open the app on that device with the same artice.
__label__0 Just a simple switch that says to the OS, during quiet hours only use vibrate mode to alert me of a call or SMS breaking through.
__label__0 For example: I drag and drop C:\Folder\image.bmp file onto my app window and my app will generate C:\Folder\image.png So what I need is a simple API like: void OnFilesDropped(String file_names[] int window_client_pos_x int window_client_pos_y) {..} where 'file_names' is an array of full path names of all files/folders drag and dropped onto the app and other 2 parameters are the XY coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured.
__label__0 Future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead.
__label__0 __________________________________________________
__label__0 I need a way to create a mouse cursor (CoreCursor) from my own data, such as: RGBA8 array of pixel colors int w, int h - size of the image int x, int y - hot_spot in the image.

Currently there's no way to dynamically create a mouse cursor.

All Win32, Mac, Linux have API's to do so, but UWP doesn't.
__label__0 Well from IE you can also search.
__label__0 The Problem: The apps are accessible with the Store link: e.g. https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFJ323
__label__1 Upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too.
__label__0 I am considering future options for puchasing devices.
__label__0 Try to send the same attachement with 2 different email one with a line in the body and another with a lot of lines and see the difference in the attachement size.
__label__0 Some SVG files may be dynamically generated by a remote server - SVG data loaded in a XAML view may have internal named elements.
__label__0 public void FocusAtPoint(double x, double y) method is not listed in PhotoCamera[from metadata] when i press F12 on PhotoCamera in text editor.
__label__0 When I visit certain ogg-based podcast feeds (such as http://thebugcast.org/ ), the embedded player shows as a video rather than an audio player, and the player controls do not work.
__label__0 The Feedly App is showing me an error since a couple of days.
__label__1 An API so the Facebook integration features can be expanded upon as well as other social networks added
__label__0 I have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will.
__label__0 Language problem
__label__1 Please add background to TextBlock control.
__label__0 Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine.
__label__1 Essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules
__label__0 All this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the OS has.
__label__0 Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen, to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.
__label__0 On my Devices i set the UI to english but want to see all TimeStamps and Dates in the German format...
__label__0 So please consider this request.
__label__1 I hope everyone can publish fonts on the store
__label__0 This item can read every page that you visit your bank, your web email, your Facebook page, and so on.
__label__0 There is currently no way, how to display in WebView HTTPS web page with invalid certificate, even with user specific opt-in.


__label__1 Make all developers become more familiar with WinRT 3.
__label__0 So something like: PeerFinder.AlternateIdentities[Bluetooth:UnPaired] = ;
__label__0 But there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win10 Insider preview.
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files, In this case i wanna suggest you that you can make Windows Phone 7 fully unlock option, Means if any user want to unlock Windows Phone 7 then he/she can unlock it.
__label__0 A translate this website button like is has on desktop and chrome also would be much helpful on a mobile device
__label__1 You reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing (vimperator, pentadactyl), please replace all links you emulated with divs (eg menu on the left) with real hrefs, so these are found by such tools.
__label__1 I would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call.
__label__0 Windows Phone__________________________________________________________________________________________________________Windows Phone_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______Live ID_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__label__1 In keeping with current MS strategy of bringing cross-platform apps to the Windows Store making Notepad one of these would be extremely helpful
__label__0 This would be ease of use
__label__0 Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly.
__label__1 We need to open the window as maximized.
__label__1 I'd like to see an API to create virtual MIDI ports built into Windows.
__label__1 Just to hardcode API keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered.
__label__1 Would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane.
__label__0 I use an event to change opacity to 1 once the image is loaded and sized and immediately I noticed that instead of just displaying the image faded in with a 1-second animation.
__label__0 That has at least 2 disadvantages: 1 more work to do for programmers (always check if user has changed the language and notify the webservice so it can change Toast messages 2 if user changes language and dont start app, there is no way of notifying the webservice that is has changed, so user will get wrong language toasts.. Change it to a localizable mechanism please
__label__1 MS' could even add features like they have in Media Center for Sports such as a ticker feed and Fantasy player tracking.
__label__0 In html if you align text to the right, then its size is reduced.
__label__0 it logs off account 1 when logging into account 2).
__label__0 But of course they exist in the store.___ more
__label__0 Currently I'm developing an app for posting photos to a user's Picasa account.
__label__0 Some tasks need to run frequently for very short periods.
__label__0 However with the new dashboard this is the only information that is provided on the dashboard.
__label__0 I'm creating this control using inspiration from the great Material Design WPF toolkit.
__label__0 If we try to use one of those it answers with a parameter incorrect without any details.
__label__0 nofificaiones center had to be moved from the left meego guy already looks better and cleaner and so would not be copied anyone since nokia who introduced this feature as bought a nokia, also all in the family
__label__1 Recommendation: ContentDialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to.
__label__1 Xbox Music: -Should be able to swap music player sideways.
__label__1 I recognize that when Threshold arrives (code matching between Windows and Windows Phone achieves 100%), much of these may not matter anymore, but for the time being these would be nice additions.
__label__0 AdControl on Xbox in Retail Mode crashes app works fine in Dev Mode or on Desktop & Mobile.
__label__0 Ever since you changed the rating algorithm the are apps that can't be found.

This happens on the Windows Phone and Windows store, apps that prior to your changes were making decent downloads are now to 0.
__label__0 On Android this is no problem.
__label__0 Please support it if you want to make XAML capable of amazing animations.
__label__0 I'm aware of the sandboxing.
__label__0 The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago but you won't know until you try to send something which isn't desirable).
__label__0 The Whiteboard app for example resizes graphic images with pinch/stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios.
__label__0 I used to be able to recommend Windows Mobile phones, because we used Windows Media Streaming Server and it had Windows Media Player.
__label__0 I write a lot support ticket on this, but no one really cares on this issue.
__label__0 The very early work in progress version is available on my repo: https://github.com/japf/uwp-material-clock
__label__0 Currently Dev Center accepts Credit Card and PayPal as payment instrument for registration fee, but please add bank transfer (wire transfer) for registration fee.

Especially some company needs to complicated process when personal credit card is used for such purpose.

When Microsoft sends a money between the company for your business partner for example outsourced call center, do you use credit card for such payment?
__label__0 NV12 and Gray8 are two basic formats but they don't be supported.
__label__0 This is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a Service Discovery browser.
__label__1 Would be nice if that was possible.
__label__0 When the app gets built, it generates a single package that can be___ more
__label__0 GET IT OFF!
__label__1 Check the Create date on the file.
__label__0 Please support SMIL animations in XAML.
__label__0 M$ just displays 4 lines.
__label__0 It's imprecise and frustrating, and confuses the user as he's not used to this behavior in system apps.
__label__0 Back in DirectSound you could do L/R panning with any Wave sample-rate.
__label__1 It would be great to be able to get the current appointment and the next appointment a user has.
__label__0 (I've also posted it over at the WP Community site, too.)
__label__0 Lifehacker is a good example.
__label__1 Other Formats like MP3 or OGG would be nice.
__label__0 Two problems: I have to click twice on a YouTube video to be played.
__label__0 After having tried TypeConverter on UWP I tried to add implicit operators (casts) to the complex type (Position here) from and to string but xaml does not take them into account.
__label__0 A good is example of this is the_____ more
__label__0 After entering Google username and password I get onto the Moved temporarily page.
__label__1 Would be nice to have a callback on for example the phonecalltask so that we can determine wether or not the user actually did press call or cancel.
__label__1 Launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message.
__label__0 However I am developing a Chinese (zh-TW) app using MapControl on my computer.
__label__1 I would like the Feedly Chrome app to act just like the Google Reader one, shows how many feeds I have and I can click on them individually.
__label__1 The Clipboard content for example a file copied in the Clipbord get lost if the the App is closed but it should be persistent.
__label__0 We just switched to Win10 SDK 10.0.14393.0 and are now getting some new warnings in .cpp files with #include <Windows.h>
__label__0 in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.
__label__0 Best regards from Germany
__label__1 Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.
__label__0 Nowadays there is not any feature to make call forwarding / call divert once I hace pick up the incoming call.
__label__0 This is a missing feature since windows mobile.
__label__1 Pls fix it ASAP!
__label__0 I am running Windows Phone 8.1 Lumia Denim on a Nokia Lumia 930 with Nextgen Reader 6.2.0.17
__label__0 That would be wonderful.
__label__1 e.NewItems but simple pick the first one.
__label__0 Option to browse In private.
__label__0 (For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?
__label__0 On lumia 925, i am running: OS: 8.10.12382.878 Firmware revision number: 3051.4000.1345.1003 Hardware revision number:0.5.0.1 Radio software version: 3.2.0407.1 Chip SOC version: 8960 The problem occurs when i read my emails, which are pulled form microsoft exchange server, using built in exchange client.
__label__0 I have already selected the appropriate category for you leave this feedback.
__label__0 That could be disruptive in a meeting.
__label__1 If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available.
__label__0 My users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app/platform (!)
__label__0 But many of developers don't.
__label__0 StorageFolder.GetFilesAsync() is incredibly slow (~7 seconds for a folder with ~3500 files).

Back in Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight-times, I was able to get the content of the CameraRoll much faster (via the MediaLibrary, <1 second for the same amount of files).
__label__1 This should also be fixed in the WP7 SDK (where all page templates, including the Pivot template, still use PhoneTextNormal style for the title).
__label__1 Please extend the API to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode.
__label__0 The WrapGrid makes it possible to display a fully adaptable UI since as the container gets narrower on small screens everything can still be seen.
__label__0 Photos, email, internet, games, and stability in their learning curve.
__label__1 Would be great if setter had Delay property to only execute it after a certain amount of time.
__label__0 However there is still a 5mm gap at the top of the page (not including the space for the time etc) that is wasteful.
__label__0 We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.
__label__1 A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.
__label__0 And what may cause that phenomenon?
__label__1 Improve microsoft account login usability in app.
__label__1 Prevent full-trust apps from targeting phone and Xbox if you have to.
__label__0 It should be enough to make the URLs match the actual URL of the open app.
__label__0 Note that a Windows Forms implementation probably won't work because of deep-seated incompatibilities in the Windows Forms architecture.
__label__0 I really have no objection to paying for an app if the developer has done an awesome job, but I take offence to the fact there are developers who mislead customers with the promise of something free and only mention the ads and limited functionality etc once you run it.
__label__1 It will be helpful for many developers if a few sample new project templates which show when and where variables can be created, instantiated so that better app experiences can be given to users.
__label__0 Adding trial-mode in Windows Phone feels like implement-and-pray.
__label__0 It should have been 2018-02-07 16:06 (or later)
__label__0 The WP7 map control lets one adjust layer Opacity.
__label__0 It is extremely poor invoice, no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementary school student?
__label__1 As you know, online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days.

I may be overlooking it, but it would beneficial to both devs and Microsoft if Windows Universal apps had access to a universal server for networking apps together.
__label__0 Only Horizontal Scrolling available because its one row only
__label__1 it will be great, if APP can access files in Documents dir.
__label__0 Most probably the problem is in these two lines:
__label__1 I suggest these new maximum lengths: title 500 characters, description 10000 characters (same as for app description).
__label__1 I think the whole system of submitting a idea is fine for a add on, but the system needs a overhaul.
__label__0 Thankyou
__label__0 I wanted to delete the extra one but but could not.
__label__0 View in normal and flick a cross screen to view slides.
__label__1 Allow Zune music + video tile in windows phone 7 to fetch metadata and display artist images and artist names in India too ... settings>applications >lock+wallpaper >show artist image when playing music under lock screen .
__label__0 The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations.
__label__1 Introduce Userchoice Dialog if AccessException is raised.
__label__0 Win32 apps still dominate because they're so robust and developed.
__label__0 I made a UWP app with a ListView (using KeepLastItemInView).
__label__0 Why is the UWP team stubbornly resisting this?
__label__1 It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.
__label__0 For example, suppose you wanted to color a US map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way.
__label__0 why the need Access to data on ALL websites.	
__label__1 Microsoft Support recommended me to post the issue here.

There seems to be a long-standing serious issue with the Store (or possibly the dev portal) which needs to be addressed urgently.
__label__0 But for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective.
__label__0 (I already have a database file encrypted by SQL Cipher and I just have to read the records)
__label__1 when playing a video from an HTML5 video tag the player should allow the user to drag the progress bar to seek ahead in the video.
__label__1 It's not exposed by the SDK, please fix it!
__label__0 Only Horizontal Scrolling available because its one row only
__label__0 It also knows the bus schedule so it will tell me when I need to be at a bus stop.
__label__0 Developing desktop apps for UWP is subpar as many API are not present like SqlClient.
__label__0 This reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction.
__label__0 Here is a related StackOverflow question:
__label__0 When you click on an rss feed in firefox it shows you a preview of the current feed with an option to subscribe to it.	
__label__0 Windows Phone 8 includes a new Map control.
__label__1 This burden would be eliminated would MP3 Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode.
__label__0 This just makes me angry as a serious developer!

__label__0 the public contacts or the calendar.

__label__0 But there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win10 Insider preview.

__label__0 Don't want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that.
__label__0 Google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading of eBooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading of ebooks but none of theme have inbuilt dictionary and they lack in many features in terms of user experience.
__label__0 This burns Microsoft time as well as developer time.
__label__1 It would be nice to have a command-line tool to submit apps to the store.
__label__1 Developers shouldn't get bad ratings and reviews when something is broken in a Preview build just because you release unfinished builds to users who have no idea what Preview means, other than getting the new cool stuff first.
__label__1 Please add to Manage users Account-level permission Show notifications for disable/enable this option.

__label__0 If there were an Extras menu option in IE where 3rd party apps could be plugged in, it would be possible to pass perhaps the URL of the currently selected site onto apps that could add value - for instance, by giving the option to subscribe to an RSS or Atom feed where present.
__label__0 If you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working.
__label__0 Using DeviceInformation::FindAllAsync in my C++/CX application to enumerate existing MIDI ports on the system.
__label__0 It's only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device
__label__1 Just like the picture extras ... it'd be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can share a piece of text with in addition to email and sms.
__label__0 I don't think this is a good design for BingMapsDirectionsTask, it's not flexible.
__label__0 Visual Studio provides a Edit and Continue feature allowing a developer to write code while debugging.
__label__0 The LaunchUriForResultsAsync method works fine.
__label__0 I find it easier to keep up with my subscriptions in Feedly than in YouTube!

__label__0 At the moment it is private (and inaccessible via Reflection because of trust levels), which makes unique contact/appointment identification impossible.
__label__1 Increase FutureAccessList limit (like in millions)
__label__1 I know it already does that for Android app, well, because Android OS lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when I hit 'Share' icon in the feedly app but it would be awesome to have it in the web app.
__label__0 Reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day.
__label__0 Windows 10 latest updates (May 2017)

__label__0 The vast majority of the documentation for the APIs is auto-generated descriptions of classes, interfaces and so on.
__label__1 At least please provide app price conversion list between USD and local currency.
__label__1 I wish I could select connection speed for debugging in the emulator.
__label__0 This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because it's totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.

__label__1 Please, to have competitive advantage, i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast.
__label__0 I started using a new Chrome app called Hacker Vision.	
__label__0 ______IME__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__label__0 Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
__label__1 It would be nice to have an indicator on the Chrome extension icon to remind me if I have saved items to review.
__label__0 It's mini mode has exactly the same limitation.
__label__1 There would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work such as specifying a Username textbox.
__label__1 Advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application.
__label__0 I have Googled and found at the moment, Feedly only works on one web browser which is Google Chrome.
__label__0 The ability to create multiple custom start views for pinning tiles to (similar to Android and iOS).
__label__0 I have lost count of the number of times I've forgot to set it to OneWay.
__label__0 When you create a webview you simply cannot see the DOM or any normal information to see whats going on, what goes wrong and why it goes wrong.
__label__1 So I am suggesting that Microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews.
__label__0 Being able to follow reddit topics from within feedly.
__label__0 My friends have a problem with finding my app in Microsoft Store.
__label__0 Support Windows Server 2008 R2
__label__0 Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystem does not provide meaningful data for Xbox.
__label__0 When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone 8 on Nokia Lumia 1350 (OS 8.0.10517.150) I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document (using #name) doesn't work from pages using frameset (doctype is correctly set to HTML 4.01 supporting framesets).
__label__1 Pleas bring back the capability to read this information.
__label__1 However it would be useful to get more flexibility.
__label__0 We've heard a lot about the default experiences in the phone (especially the different hubs) are a great resources for developers and designers to get a feel for some real world implementations of the Metro Design Language and get inspired from them.
__label__0 These lists are are broken, so there is no actual way to find games you are looking for by category as most are only showing a handful of games per category.
__label__0 Test apps (although hidden in the store) undergo the same certification process.
__label__1 If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and 720P images, and then autoscaling the WXGA images down to WVGA through an image handler.
__label__0 I disabled the AV the result is unsucceesful.
__label__1 When I make store listings for several languages I would like to be able to just right click on a listing then copy it and edit not .be troubled with details on .cvs and excell.
__label__0 I changed the folder order via the Feedly web interface (organize) but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in Mr. Reader.
__label__1 It would be good to have a Video Chooser Task that works in the same way as the PhotoChooserTask.
__label__0 I have released several versions of the app, yet I cannot find the number of new users or the number of existing users who have upgraded to the new app version in the DEV center.
__label__0 If the user uninstalls and installs again later, we have no idea.
__label__0 I understand this is an Asus and Microsoft concern and hope this evaluation helps in the next update.
__label__0 SelectedBackground property - Gets or sets a brush that provides the background of a calendar item that's selected.
__label__1 Would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers.
__label__0 As a developer that has to stay on top of feedback I receive feedback from users around the world.
__label__0 As popular platform like Apple IOS already did this for its devs.
__label__0 There doesnt seem to be any website for this.
__label__0 Please modify like this.
__label__0 I wonder what may cause this.
__label__1 Proper socket support, a fixed UdpAnySourceMulticastClient implementation, or an explicit SSDP client which supports sending & handling replies to M-SEARCH messages should be enabled.
__label__0 In other projects/frameworks like Template 10 this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the BackRequested event first.
__label__0 Setting up Conversion Environment
__label__0 Some basic things to filter would be:
__label__0 Want to add an image (like Radar, Cloud layer, drone image, etc) to a Phone Map and have it scale relative to the zoom layer.
__label__0 I cba to leave feedly but I want to know what other people are saying and I want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything.
__label__0 How UWP apps can compete with other systems with such things?
__label__0 Please advise.
__label__0 THIS IS BAD.
__label__0 I've noticed that when you create a DataPackage containing both data provided directly (let's say text using SetData) and delayed formats like a bitmap (using SetDataProvider) when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared.
__label__0 I also couldn't create a Mediaelement in Codebehind because it needs a strange path for phones and throws an exception.
__label__1 Please add support for icons with a transparent background in the Games list.
__label__1 Another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom - showing related apps - as long as they meet a certain review standard - to promote cross visibility.
__label__0 Discussion request for commenters: Visual Studio accepts bugs for Windows Phone at https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/ -- is being able to file WPDev bugs here sufficient?
__label__0 I'm SUPER grateful that you guys got it working at all by July 1st, but this is something that will need to be fixed.
__label__1 Extend the MediaElement to support YouTube videos, so simple.
__label__1 I wish the InterstitialAd will have built-in animation at least a fade-in effect when it shows.
__label__0 Please fix this annoying issue.
__label__1 Could this not also be provided in the UWP toolkit for inclusion in UWP apps?
__label__0 Sometimes reviews can be for previous versions of the app.
__label__0 In UWP when a MenuFlyout control is placed within a CommandBar inside the Page.TopAppBar (or BottomAppBar) in Light theme the MenuFlyoutPresenter has the incorrect background color.
__label__0 option to delete all conversations at once.
__label__0 99% of the applications they install aren't (and won't be!)
__label__0 This workflow sucks right now to have to confirm dialing each number.
__label__0 Some wanna use fully unlocked Windows Phone 7 for fun.
__label__0 There's no easy way to detect Left Control key pushes.
__label__1 I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers.
__label__1 With the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make UWP apps much easier to distribute outside of the store.
__label__0 
Unfortunately, neither the SmartCard class nor the SmartCardProvisioning class (nor any other related class) provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later.
__label__0 I assume saving to the MediaLibrary will be part of the AR functionality in mango anyway?
__label__0 Currently its very hard to debug Hybrid and Webapps.
__label__0 This would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting.
__label__0 - Sometimes when I seek the video by changing Position property, I've got a trouble with infinite loop of buffering and video never play again.
__label__0 at Convert-Files C:\Program
__label__1 I would like to get Short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on Lockscreen.
__label__1 I know I can watch them via mirroring on the computer - but something more native would be appreciated.
__label__0 With all the new screen sizes and resolutions, testing in the emulator is certainly one way to try them out, but it'd aid in even more rapid development to be able to see them on the design surface like we already have for WVGA, WXGA, and 720p sizes.
__label__0 I found this thread on Github: https://github.com/winjs/winjs/issues/1654
__label__1 I wish to connect feedy with social networks (youtube, vimeo, tumblr, instagram,...) to synchronize the news and our favorites.
__label__0 This behavior is not found in public documentation.
__label__0 This feature is available on Android (I heard even on iPhone) An essential and very beneficial feature, that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user.
__label__1 I suggest a Feedly to Google Calendar feature.
__label__1 I suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode (convert) an instance to and from a string.
__label__0 In our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx.
__label__1 Can you use a traditional address bar button?
__label__0 Doesn't suport the IE8.	
__label__0 I was expecting that if people search for Match then also it should work, but unfortunately it seems to be searching whole word.
__label__0 Its funny how Zune has the ability to sort Pictures by name but when they get synced to a Windows 7 Phone it loses that ability.
__label__0 Currently the only way to set BackgroundDownloader's header is by SetHeader method unfortunately once you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method:
__label__0 But not the Mappolygon which is sad as I want to draw tracks and other information that is based on lat/long coordinates and want them to be drawn on the map as they used to in bing maps.
__label__1 The software should allow JavaScript to be used through internet explorer.
__label__0 One can read more here: http://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/post/2012/01/06/Framework-Exceptions-in-Windows-Phone.aspx
__label__0 This seems a bad way to manage window size.
__label__1 I want to have sounds enabled to keyboard but not at highest level, also i want to listen to radio (throuth the night) and be sure that the next morning the alarm clock will sound as high as possible to wake me up.
__label__0 The values will then be concatenated.
__label__0 No need to open the app.
__label__0 If B and C were to be built with different versions of A, how will he use B and C on our projects?
__label__0 This makes Visual Studio fail to start the debugging session.
__label__0 We use Microsoft Expression Encoder to do live, smooth streaming, video feeds.
__label__0 I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
__label__0 Text effects are not just for fancy/weird text.
__label__0 This would provide much powerful photo apps for real time shutting and photo editing.
__label__0 Plain Text is not for professional apps today.
__label__0 when there is a lot of names,numbers in the call log,a time filter will be great.a incoming,outgoing and missed calls filter is also needed.
__label__1 Please add support for icons with a transparent background in the Games list.
__label__0 But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product.
__label__0 When I try to save to Pocket though I get Please configure ....
__label__0 Please note not all requests can be completed.
__label__1 It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.
__label__0 I’ve spent some hours to build a small MVVM/UWP/Pivot Prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in WPF with TabControl.
__label__0 We can see page-rotate effect on settings page.
__label__1 Give ability to create games that have access for xbox live achievements.
__label__1 Could you add this to the list of UWP APIs supported in Desktop Bridge?
__label__0 When the event is over (new day arrives), the tile won't update.
__label__0 People Hub __________________________________________________________________
__label__0 This is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to.
__label__0 Case:- if i mute my phone in any state ringer+ notifications or media+ apps it mutes successfully.. but un-mute function does not works smoothly..restart required to un- mute...2 time observed not always.
__label__1 Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports.
__label__1 Show a notice to users upon install… more
__label__0 Not really sure where to put this, so i'm going to ask here.
__label__0 Because WVGA and WXGA are the same aspect ratio, and because the website is a giant PITA in uploading images, you have to take and submit 3 screenshots per actual screenshot per language.
__label__0 I got several user feedback if I could provide a larger compact overlay.
__label__0 Basic scenario is the need to store set of secret API keys for various 3-rd party APIs (twitter for example).
__label__0 I hope I can set my App price is $0.2, but I can't now.
__label__1 Facebook for WinPho needs better integration with Facebook!
__label__0 In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.
__label__0 The era of connected TV is here.
__label__0 I'm developing more than 10 applications, however, has encountered an obstacle.
__label__0 At the moment anyone breaking through quiet hours does so at full volume.
__label__0 Hi All, Apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong place!
__label__0 This was great because it allowed other services to get their apps in the store that magically replicated one's camera roll to the cloud service, and allowed users to have a choice as to what cloud service they would use.
__label__0 If their app like mine is published solely to the Xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app.
__label__0 PrivateObject and PrivateType are missing in Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.UnitTestFramework
__label__0 Hard to learn a new software, not dynamic as developers want to create dynamic 3d shapes at runtime.
__label__1 Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included.
__label__0 When the user starts video playback on a phone we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar (on devices such as Lumia 950 that has them)… more
__label__0 There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.
__label__0 The ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread, save even read the whole article Like an interactive radio
__label__0 This would help in hit testing of Visuals.
__label__0 Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state.
__label__0 Quite unfortunate.
__label__0 Suppose I want this to happen under program control.
__label__0 all apps go to freeze position so a user cannot use the mobile if any app is used for downloading.
__label__0 It will help to keep cleanness and order in the Dashboard if you allow developers to delete from the list apps or in-app products that will never be published again.
__label__1 Please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update.
__label__1 i just wish i could archive and group or send to another read later app from there to organize
__label__0 some certificates was wrong.
__label__0 Word Files that the user has created or uploaded to the device an use them in code.
__label__0 The engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following: 1.
__label__0 Internal use of apps is defined as a beta test and requires a list of Live IDs designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app.
__label__1 I suggest to create another option that alternates lost of signal and bad signal.

Create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time.

From 1 to 10 sec, for example.
__label__0 You can check using below example
__label__0 This would extend the power already available with share pickers to perform more generic tasks, and would result in a better experience for the user.
__label__0 Other implementations of SQL CE already support full-text indexes (i.e.
__label__1 Add Payoneer as a payment method for Windows Phone Store / Windows Store / PubCenter earnings.
__label__0 I have not finished yet and I am learning everyday.
__label__0 By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage, the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime, dynamically download them from other places etc.
__label__0 We used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in XAML - There____s a lot of free source SVG files that usable under creative commons on Wikipedia for things like US maps, electoral districts and many other rich features.
__label__1 I'd like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file as well as support for setting log levels.
__label__0 I can understand that tapping on the reminder___ more
__label__0 The values will then be concatenated.
__label__1 The results of which could be hosted anywhere that HTML5/JS can run, notably iOS and Droid platforms.
__label__0 The function would get the original text and is expected to return either XAML objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by the control.
__label__0 That means: - Custom Markup Extensions - XamlServices.Load and Save - All default system markup extensions {x:Null}, {x:Static}, etc. found in WPF/Silverlight5.
__label__0 Currently, you can submit an app to all countries, or specific countries.
__label__1 Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time.
__label__0 The advantage of XAML to natively support SVG with SMIL is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver SVGs to you.
__label__0 VPN !!!
__label__1 The SDK itself support the side-by-side installation then we can try the new API with our UWP Apps.
__label__0 :-) Hello, thank you for this site.
__label__0 Press delete.
__label__0 But logging out and back in is no good since I am not asked which account I want to use.
__label__0 However, having a look at the battery of my Lumia 620, the label states that it has 1'300 mAh, and not mWh.
__label__1 I have more than 20 apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these 20 apps as a number.
__label__1 Market it more as a visual assistant.
__label__0 As a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the XBOX platform.
__label__1 Enable recording of FM radio.
__label__0 Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information I can get the job done in a few days.
__label__0 Like the Dashboard update Twist Control from the XBox360!
__label__0 When uploading an app bundle of an Universal app to either the Window or Windows Phone store, the version is displayed as 2015.523.... instead of the version the developer set for the package.

This is very confusing and a question was asked several times in the forums (see https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d2913ad6-6130-45b6-8a7f-086ff7f04cff/problem-with-version-number?forum=wpsubmit) Please comment and document this behavior
__label__0 The biggest issue/ask is to deploy an app to an emulator via that command line tool, in much the same way the AppDeployCmd worked for 8.1.
__label__0 Wifi and bluetooth work well but the mobileBroadband is in This value is defined for future use and is not currently available.
__label__0 Particularly as the number of optional device images that developers can download and install increase, this becomes a more critical need to keep the Windows Phone development workspace clean.
__label__0 Since Microsoft haven't introduced a native C++ SDK for WP7 Please create a PC emulator in C# for WP7.
__label__1 -Should be able to control music ( Play, Pause, Next & Previous + song info ) directly from the notification center.
__label__1 Include the mouse and keyboard support.
__label__1 For example an IsSelected property could be added to a TreeViewNode or a function like selectNode(TreeViewNode) to the TreeView.
__label__1 The Playback Devices and Recording Devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better UI.
__label__0 I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they're doing.
__label__0 Example: Map is centered on ground I move it to building and altitude jumps to building's height
__label__0 using send to compressed ZIP folder with files > 4GB outputs non-ISO-21320-1:2015-conforming files which results in errors in many unzip softwares including 'unzip' reference implementation from info-zip.org as well as 7zip libarchive libzip and others.
__label__0 because the metro ui can not very quickly find app for lots of app shortcut
__label__0 It is in an app called Drudge Live (https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdm04m) and in the app the swipe-open capability is only enabled on phones.
__label__0 The current implementation of the Http*Content classes exposed by the Windows.Web.Http namespace do not allow adding Custom headers to the Http content.

If developers need to create a request with multiple instances of MIME content (e.g. an email and an attachment), they need a capability to add the Content-Transfer-Encoding and Content-ID headers to each of the mime contents.
__label__1 Please cant we have an option in the WPAppManifest file to untick fast resume and allow WP8.1 apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in WP8?
__label__1 We can also change lock screen background.
__label__0 Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto/visible (latter is currently ignored).
__label__1 Please return to the Windows Phone Dev Center for more information (0x80043001)' message.
__label__0 IE 9 VERSION ?
__label__1 An example is in VS I have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the.
__label__0 This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution (1280x720).
__label__0 Especially the FLV has been widely used among renowned video sharing sites, for example YouTube.
__label__0 Business case: Home and enterprise users would most likely pay for an application that will control behavior of ringer volume and notifications based on geographic location.
__label__0 These are widely used in the real world today.
__label__1 Please add the possibility to open HTML files that are located in the folders in the phone's memory.
__label__1 A developer should have the possibility to write his own complete implementation of background audio player or the built-in one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio title/album without pausing playback.
__label__0 Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone ___ that is ridiculous!
__label__0 We all have to use BackgroundMediaPlayer if we want the audio to continue even when the app is minimized.
__label__1 Build instagram, oovoo and yahoo messenger for wp 7.8
__label__0 This is helpful for layout debugging.
__label__1 Add new colors
__label__0 It's impossible to select a value when the list contains a lot of items!
__label__1 At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version.
__label__0 Why not we push store apps adds on msn web site?
__label__0 Touch screen is way too sensitive after 8.1 upgrade.
__label__0 Similar issue: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/7761381-allow-to-develop-and-test-windows-phone-apps-on-al

__label__0 This function might change the independent news market in a similar way as Amazons Kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account.
__label__0 An example of the second might be: ______I really enjoy doing crossword puzzles, so I____ll type ______Crosswords____ into the search box so that I can find and download a crossword app that I play during my commute to work__.
__label__1 When saving to (Pocket in this case) a third party app, having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful.
__label__0 Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed.
__label__0 MediaFrameSourceKind.Custom is not available on the XBOX.
__label__0 Microsoft should provide a SDK for developers to intergate such feedback system in their Apps.
__label__0 However this feature is not present in the Store app on the Xbox.
__label__0 I'm using Win 10 pro x64 and having problem when saving a 150MB mp4 file from my smart phone to desktop.

My PC becomes unresponsive.

I could not open task manager nor Start menu even after restarting Windows.

It keeps hanging after I login.

At the first time, I didn't know to to fix the error so I had to factory reset my PC.
__label__0 Silverlight doesn't work properly in IE 11, so I cannot upload xap files using IE 11.
__label__0 There are design toolkits available for several designer programs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/downloads/index.
__label__0 (common sense)
__label__1 It'd be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps.
__label__0 This works fine on the iPhone but not on iPad.
__label__0 windows app development freedom
__label__0 As is, one has to open each post one wants to read later.	
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files,___ more
__label__0 Why should I have to implement a ContactPicker to make the user choose, or implement the Live SDK and force them to log in, when the phone already knows?
__label__0 Ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see.
__label__1 Add PinchIn and PinchOut events, they are common events.
__label__0 That would rock live tiles capabilities to extreme...
__label__0 it wont let me cconnect it just sais turn on
__label__1 Please add to UWP BLE API methods to interrogate BLE stack connection settings.
__label__0 I'm guessing this is a bug because it doesn't produce an understandable exception.
__label__0 If you are professional developer, redesign (your company loves this word) the formal business invoice!
__label__0 Hello Sir/Ma'am.

__label__0 This option is very important when RSS feed contains only text excerpt.
__label__0 My Windows is Version 1709 Build 16299.19.
__label__0 Will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page?
__label__0 I need to implement a such thing for my own project.
__label__0 Expectation: User swipes from the left to the right to reveal the options on the left (as if dragging the item to the right to reveal options behind it)
__label__0 However this is impossible with all existing API's.
__label__1 Make it so the Xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder 5.
__label__1 Windows phone store should show total number of app downloads (All Markets) as well as ratings and reviews of All Markets instead of showing rates.

So, Please make store on phone show total app downloads all over the world as well as total rating and reviews of all regions.
__label__1 Could you put in an update to reduce boot time by 2 seconds.

And make the start screen interactions smoother?

Such as swiping from start, to the list of all apps And could you reduce the time it takes for a windows app to open by 1 second e.g messaging, phone etc.
__label__0 After all, it is so easier to just allow to renew than you MS having to work for transfering data from one account to another.
__label__0 For example MS provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about Win10 Fall CU.
__label__0 App tested is WebView Release.
__label__1 The best answer would be to simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages.
__label__0 A media picker control that you could activate that would let the user go through their media library and check off a list of songs or videos.
__label__0 Remember Steve Balmer - developers developers developers.
__label__0 At least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or a serious one and we have to way days.
__label__0 This does not occur in Google Reader, where the original layout displays normally.
__label__0 Import alert tones
__label__0 share a app like in the marketplache but in the menu
__label__0 The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access.
__label__0 Feedly always inserts quotation marks in posts to Buffer.
__label__0 We'll currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.
__label__0 With frameworks like Angular, Node, jQuery, etc becoming more popular, we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience.
__label__0 But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input.
__label__0 Right now, the value is always UnknownError.
__label__1 Can there please be an app that denies access to an app unless given a correct pin?
__label__0 I could only change it to Manually Publish and hope to delete it later.
__label__0 It's also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots… more
__label__1 UWP really needs a way to handle master-details situations easily maybe something like UISplitViewController offered in iOS SDK
__label__0 It is inconvenient for me to debug a Chinese app with MapControl while my favorite Windows display languages is en-US.
__label__1 Please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files.
__label__0 Obviously Microsoft will be the lead, and changes such as extensions supporting parsing of new versions of internal OS structures will come from Microsoft, but open-sourcing WinDbg will allow the community fix bugs like the one in .
__label__0 A small number of non-UWP desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern/UWP environment.
__label__0 Some people are resorting to the super-inefficient Apple app store method of releasing 2 versions of the app... one that shows up in the free category and another that runs as a paid app.
__label__0 This can help us implement positioning in a small aera, which just like what Apple iBeacon does.
__label__1 Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time.
__label__0 For my idea (which is a big secret !
__label__0 Say I have 100 objects to draw.
__label__0 If you either leave Idle tasks alone (they are Idle so not using system resources right?

__label__0 Currently to interact with a DataGrid's rows you must specify a SelectionChanged event.

__label__0 In addition to try/buy/install buttons on an app's marketplace listing, add a pin to wishlist option
__label__1 There should be a way to test applications on real devices without registering in the app hub, because a private person, perhaps, develops an application over a long time and so he pays 99$ each year, only that he can test the application on his mobile.
__label__1 And can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the URLs embedded in the tweets.
__label__0 BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT / Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API.
__label__0 Now let's say next day the app is opened again.
__label__0 It looks as if this value doesn't change at all... See here for details on this issue: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpdevelop/thread/b8b66a85-cc5f-4de0-9eff-51df099ca495/#b8b66a85-cc5f-4de0-9eff-51df099ca495 Thanks and best regards, Patrick Hello, According to the C# programming documentation (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.power.batteryreport.fullchargecapacityinmilliwatthours.aspx) the battery report (fullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours) should return the fully-charged energy capacity of the battery, in milliwatt-hours (mWh).

__label__0 Do you agree that it is time to have it now?
__label__0 Maybe add this to Additional Information.
__label__0 Or, if that is too difficult, please allow listing of the existing classic desktop apps in the store, the way you were_____ more
__label__0 This may seem minor but it's a huge irritant.
__label__0 Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third-party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages.
__label__1 It would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still.
__label__0 When using Windows.Media.Transcoding.MediaTranscoder to transcode ALAC file to something else it reports CodecNotFound.

__label__0 The problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the On-Screen-Keyboard.
__label__0 We've inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal.
__label__1 I think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didn't view, just like android and IOS, but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn WiFi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have 2.
__label__1 They should never pass certification, and should never be published.
__label__0 In v-sync mode I've cleared it more times to get below 60 fps limit.
__label__0 Still today 3D mouses USB-connected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly.
__label__1 It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one-way binding.
__label__0 Fix it if you can.
__label__0 If you change the price, it need to pass certification again.
__label__1 Wish I can undo that patch.
__label__0 On Windows 8.1 / RT 8.1 che call to the PickContactAsync() works but I receive wrong data instaed, for example: FirstName and LastName are both in FirstName (and LastName is___ more

__label__0 I have a scenario when my user wants to sign into two different accounts.
__label__0 The apps all go to the same facebook page.
__label__0 In the beginning of WP7 users had to register a new live-account and set the location to US to get access to the marketplace for example.

__label__0 It's working great on physical machines.
__label__1 And Twitter tweets from your followers can be another feed.

__label__0 If we can hold payouts we could hold them until we reach a reasonable amount and then pressing ok to pay out if you are allowed.
__label__0 ).
__label__0 I have an implementation that I'm more than happy to provide.
__label__0 The way Flipboard has implemented Twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it, so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image, it simply gets the article content or image and displays it, with any text of the tweet acting as a caption.	
__label__0 Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information I can get the job done in a few days.
__label__1 In my case I would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something I could live without :).
__label__0 I've only noticed this on two feeds, my own blog and XKCD's.
__label__0 But not the Mappolygon which is sad as I want to draw tracks and other information that is based on lat/long coordinates and want them to be drawn on the map as they used to in bing maps.
__label__0 We've discovered just today that WebGL does not work in WebView in UWP apps compiled as x86 on Windows 10 1803.
__label__0 Potential scenarios: - Developer doesn't have SLAT on their machine and wants to run the VM on a SLAT capable machine/server - Developer is running their dev environment in a virtual environment (e.g., local Hyper-V, remote Hyper-V, Parallels) and wants to run the emulator in another child VM on the same physical host they are running on (since she can't run a VM inside of a VM) - The ability to run a dev environment fully___ more
__label__0 In the Health page of Dev Center analytics crashes and hangs can be filtered by OS version (RTM150715111607 etc.).
__label__0 Currently if you ever mistakenly selected a ru language than you will be in a very bad situation forever: - You can live with the wrong Tile displayed for Russian language in the Store (the english one) or - You can publish an update with the removed ru language, but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble: 1.)
__label__0 The current status only seems to show ‘In Progress’ if the app has never been put in the store before.
__label__0 With access to the song binary, this data could just be created by the dev.
__label__0 Instead in W10M it opens just when I release the finger.
__label__1 Allow Windows Phones to compete for end users and enterprise clients on par with Apple/Android (Currently these phones have applications that include location based ringer volume) 3.
__label__0 Mailing list would be great as well.; Great job!
__label__0 one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes..
__label__1 I'd love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a 2D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel.
__label__0 However this can be easily fixed by writing it in Dev Center.
__label__0 Today apps ar silos.
__label__0 This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog, but being able, as a developer.
__label__1 So why not include EnablePullToRefresh as a property of MasterDetailsView.

__label__0 The Acquisitions Funnel in the new Windows Developer Center dashboard is cool but the rectangular bars representing each stage of the funnel are incorrect.
__label__1 I think this is a bug, because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property, it should also update the PixelBuffer, or the data is inconsistent.
__label__0 This makes a hassle when trying to use something that I think is awesome when it does work right.

__label__0 The Problem: The apps are accessible with the Store link: e.g. https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFJ323 But if you try to search for it, e.g. Announcements for Windows, the app is not listed.
__label__0 Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.
__label__0 Is not news that Window mobile won't have a chance against the major OSs out in the market so I was thinking why try to implement something new when what is out there can be used for good on Microsoft side?
__label__0 This is the crezy idea:

__label__0 Unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process.
__label__0 Since UMDF USB drivers are absolutely safe from harming___ more
__label__0 These are only my suggestions, there may be smarter ways to achieve this, but in the end, the current functionallity is pointless.
__label__0 It seems that saving the CookieContainer isn't possible.

__label__0 _ As you can see, it fails at the position where the > should be.
__label__1 I understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the Mailboxes in the phone, but there should be an API to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics, like the number of unread emails, number of important emails, and the total e-mail count.
__label__0 More convenient than using multitask function.
__label__0 Is there any way to select (a) location source(s) to use, like on other platforms?
__label__1 It'd be great to have a way to add these feeds to Feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from Feedly

__label__0 RCS messaging allows networks to send text messages over a data connection.
__label__0 Additional, the Watcher provided notifications about a number of the unreaded articles.
__label__1 I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows 7 but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows 10 before writing apps for it.
__label__0 Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to use these APIs instead, unfortunately they are also unreliable.
__label__0 This gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong (and with IE10 a lot can go wrong, IE11 is better but still not as easy to make cross-platform apps run like on Android and iOS).
__label__0 I currently I use a wp71 class library to access the fm api's, but these does not provide the means of changing the audio route.
__label__0 Currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access.
__label__0 some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action.
__label__0 Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users.
__label__0 Not much point opening app by voice now, if you then have to pick up phone to operate app.
__label__0 This rigid rule makes it impossible to make a functional 3rd party calendar app.
__label__0 I realize that your link still pings my link and get the analytics, but i have a custom URL for a reason.
__label__1 Add API for access point configuration, so server could send needed data via push notification and application would create new corporate WLAN access point.

__label__0 I want to communicate with the sensors in my app when phone is in standby mode.
__label__0 There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.

__label__0 when you lock your screen and keep your phone in your Jeans front pocket, sometimes your camera button is pressed for few seconds and the camera mode popsup and screen automatically unlocks, and i got almost 30 blank pictures in my camera roll.
__label__0 This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.

__label__0 Companies need to have the correct sales estimate for the accounts purposes.
__label__0 Wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious___ more
__label__0 I like that Instapaper is an option, but it's very clunky.	
__label__0 PCM audio encoding is the only available one, it is needed to have some way to encode and compress audio to WMA, MP3 or any encoding to allow smaller transfers when we have to send the audio to a web service.
__label__0 At the moment you have to open the reviews for every app, one at the time.
__label__0 I recently learned how to block the installation of window 10, for example.

__label__0 Many mobile applications are written in java.
__label__0 Adobe Acrobat doesn't allow the user to set an option to perma-hide the bookmarks pane, and I guestimate that 99% of the PDFs Feedly Pro generates only have one bookmark (the article title).
__label__0 This would signify communication and access on the file system.
__label__0 Google Reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every URL you threw at it, and it doesn't seem to be terribly complicated.
__label__0 Right now I have to manage this myself.
__label__0 This fee applies only to alternative payment methods (e.g.
__label__0 Apps can't show the traveled route at___ more

__label__0 These devices have a simple network interface an cannot be extended for several reasons (flash size, communication library).
__label__0 At the moment only one idea is marked as planed.
__label__0 let there be more than 9.

__label__0 Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Support.
__label__1 Change the Store search engine algorithm back, to as it was.

To make it possible to actually find an app by its title.

__label__0 This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.
__label__1 It would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message.
__label__0 Tags could be good and bad depending on how a user uses Evernote.
__label__0 A typical example: If article subject contains this week in, mark it as read.

__label__0 There are many devices (like a USB-Madi or Dante Virtual Soundcard) which use at least 64 channels.
__label__0 The location icon appears at the top but had not been selected or activated.
__label__0 This is the most important feature lacking in WP8.
__label__0 Anyway, Im sure that Im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great.
__label__0 The new universal app model does not provide this functionality.
__label__0 Thanks you very much
__label__0 And with the VariableSizedWrapGrid you must hardwire the column-span and row-span of each item to ensure everything fits.
__label__0 I contacted support and they can't delete them either (SRX1418420784ID)
__label__0 I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
__label__1 Better people app, I like the people app with the UI and the Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn integration but the thing I would like most is if you made the top thing that said people was a smaller text, it take to much space on the app 7.
__label__0 The any video converter is powerful in converting multiple video of any format to FLV, so you can <strong><a href=http://www.kvisoft.com/tutorials/avi-to-flv-conversion.html>convert AVI to FLV</a></strong>, or <strong><a href=http://www.kvisoft.com/tutorials/how-to-convert-mp4-to-flv.html>convert MP4 to FLV</a></strong> etc in a breeze.</p> <p>2.

__label__0 Support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the Windows store is below anecdotal.

__label__0 To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support___ more
__label__0 There is a very annoying bug in the Windows 10 Store that hides apps form listing.
__label__1 Better than that would be an option to catch the article text and send it completely (not just the resume from rss, as some sites do), somewhat like the instapaper does.
__label__0 to visit the sites externally for EVERY page is not very convient.
__label__0 I have stated the folder names I use (Pages and UserControls) but the rule could deal with other names as well.
__label__1 Clue: have a folder for downloading and copying apps like the ringtones folder for ringtones.
__label__0 They build a package which fails without details and I can not download the build package for debugging.

__label__0 I want to use this control TreeView from this link https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/tree-view.

__label__0 To use the search button for any application in order to avoir to add everytime a custom search functionality
__label__0 Because feedly's swipe action moves to the next feed, its not possible to view the slideshow.
__label__0 It would also mean that I dont have to try and search for the video channels im subscribed to on youtube within feedly.
__label__0 Then Appium will happily use the native locator.
__label__0 Or even on a regular ol' website.
__label__1 If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL2 glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs.
__label__0 Currently, the search button only opens Bing.
__label__1 button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful.
__label__0 This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.
__label__1 Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular i.e.
__label__0 I have included code to reproduce the issue:

Kindly look into the issue.

Also would like to mention that I have Matching word in my application name.

I was expecting that if people search for Match then also it should work, but unfortunately it seems to be searching whole word.

__label__0 My idea - Large size of tiles - Interactive live tiles, we can next, pause, prev songs at xbox music live tiles, read mail without open app, etc... - Photo background, (no more dark or light), like windows 8.
__label__0 All the saved and live data are___ more
__label__0 I liked Android and now bought HTC 8s with a 32 GB microSD to find out, that App to SD is not supported.
__label__0 But when a developer submitted an app and it's failing for a reason/policies, it's worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his/her app.
__label__0 Add TreeView control to UWP same as in System.Windows.Controls.TreeView
__label__0 The state is always Unknown (when the watcher triggers Added or Updated event).
__label__1 Please add HeaderedContentControl to the community toolkit.

__label__1 It would be very helpfull to have an abbility to copy a part of text out of a message.
__label__0 When a device replies to the M-SEARCH message it sends a unicast message to the IP & port that the M-SEARCH message was sent from.
__label__1 So while it is still COM under the hood, a C++ developer should think in terms of references rather than pointers.
__label__0 It is unacceptable simply because according to RFC 2616 Section 4.1 (Header Field Definitions), the message headers of an HTTP 1.1 message value is optional.
__label__0 How we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update.

__label__0 sign and saying that these apps do not even exist in the store any more.
__label__0 However the BackgroundMediaPlayer doesn't have all the features the MediaElement had.
__label__0 The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.
__label__1 It would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.1
__label__0 It should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily.
__label__1 It would be good to backup linked contacts.
__label__0 Consider the following situation: I just bought the Gold Family Xbox LIVE package.
__label__1 I think it would be much easier to just provide APIs for the hardware encoder/decoder to edit videos on isolated storage (and with better performance)
__label__1 Please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files.
__label__1 It would be useful if this feature can be supported in Windows 10
__label__0 The page indicates Duplicate email addresses will be removed yet when I paste in duplicate email addresses they remain.
__label__1 Please extend KeyFrameAnimations/ScalarKeyFrameAnimations to makte them pausable and resumable.
__label__1 My suggestion/idea is to reduce the development time & effort needed for ASP.NET web application.
__label__1 instead of tiles  we want something attractive for instance Windows style icons more than 3 initial screens customized task-bar the action and notification center should be glass style or in customized transparency style.

__label__0 While http proxy function lost since windows phone, Now in UWP we can only set http proxy(ip+port,username+psw) in the connected Wifi manually.

__label__0 I want to thank Lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me.
__label__1 Right now we can't able to assign ItemsSource to MapIcon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple Map Icons loads from database.

__label__0 IE8 is too old and probably too many hacks to support it.
__label__0 Of couse another app have success of wack.
__label__1 Please provide an API for quiet hours in Windows 10 (mobile) where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background.

__label__0 you'll get an error if the type of VM.Data is not object.
__label__1 Apps must be found by keywords.
__label__0 As a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds.
__label__1 Please look into how musicians and developers use MIDI and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the Surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here.
__label__0 Im using Windows 10 and VS2017.I have a Finguerprint sensor and Windows hello installed and working fine.
__label__1 Add a Boolean to the CameraCaptureTask to optionally add the picture taken to the Camera Roll.
__label__0 http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/4679540-lost-password I gave my Mobile for service to replace my display.
__label__1 I'm still waiting and there is no news on Project Centennial.

You have stopped listing Classic Desktop Apps on the store.

The much promised bridge for the store called Centennial for class apps is still not in sight.

Don't you have any concern for thousands of ISVs who developed Windows utility programs in the past to make Windows popular and successful?

Please put this project on high priority so that classic apps can get on to the store.

Or, if that is too difficult, please allow listing of the existing classic desktop apps in the store, the way you were doing earlier.
__label__0 This is supported in Silverlight for the web.

__label__1 Would be cool to have an app (or even better, a command in the Store app) that saves a list of currently installed apps (after each Install / Uninstall) so, that the user can re-install all the apps as easily as updating of a number of apps takes place now.
__label__0 There are other panels in the UWP that do something similar, like the WrapGrid, but this doesn____t work well if the items are variable size.
__label__0 Unable to scroll an online video back and forth.
__label__0 With SSDs and faster processors boot up is often times only a second sometimes less.
__label__0 For example if in the msi/ appx is added folder like Samples or Projects it cannot be found by the open/ save dialogs with set Initial Directory opened by the installed executable even if the folder is installed in the installed executable's folder.
__label__1 I would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before they're inserted into our feeds.
__label__0 And a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the built-in phone app, since the app also can have a quick-button for goto the regular phone app whenever the user wants to do that.
__label__0 This clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times.
__label__1 provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles won't get collapsed accidentally.
__label__0 Is that going to be fixed?
__label__0 Here is my desktop configuration: - CPU: i7 2600K - Memory: 8G of RAM - Harddisk: 1TB - 100GB for Windows - 900GB for Data I'm using Win 10 pro x64 and having problem when saving a 150MB mp4 file from my smart phone to desktop.
__label__0 In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes visual programming animation software single/multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others.
__label__0  // Something happened update your UI or run your business logic
__label__0 If the point is outside, we have to divide the result by RawPixelsPerViewPixel.
__label__1 My suggestion is to add an option to pin the application in use, for future use, when an application is open.
__label__1 It would be good to see support for setting a GridView inside a ListView which has the ability to add columns.
__label__1 There is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re-publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage.
__label__0 1) I missed the documentation that explained how to do this.
__label__1 If FM radio APIs are brought in it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well.
__label__0 But if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data, then it would be available for the phone's real owner.
__label__0 So although in, e.g., .NET-based store apps, the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events, there doesn't appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can't actually record those events in a trace!
__label__1 The SVG data may be inline or loaded from a source (local file or remote from the web) There are few current tools for converting SVG to WPF/Silverlight-based XAML but they fall short when dealing with more complex SVG data.

This should work just like any other kind of image data.
__label__1 Also, we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app.
__label__0 The G+ hack does not work for mailing lists.
__label__0 It's some idea, please VOTE !!!
__label__0 Microsoft Support just answer this: I reviewed your account and show that the app is published correctly.
__label__1 A simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated.
__label__0 In Windows 10 (Messages for example) there is a very nice control for entering/selecting contacts to send an email or text message etc to.
__label__1 Also, if it's possible to override save for later to pocket.
__label__0 The problem occurs on every conversion.
__label__0 The main problem is that the new users don't know about third party clients/apps so, in my opinion, this could improve a lot the user_____ more
__label__0 To import an OPML file still shows a link to http://cloud/feedly.com but the link is redirecting.
__label__0 Using the touchpad/mousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the ListView.
__label__0 Texture coordinate transforms are not exposed for any effects that can be used by the Reach profile even though this is something the GPU can probably do cheaply.
__label__0 This is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only.
__label__1 I need Huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rss-feeds to this service.
__label__0 I have a scenario when my user wants to sign into two different accounts.
__label__0 Machine translation: Up the phone more Tramp in the market if you can set music as ringtone, alarms etc., as in windows I have to create ringtone Facility to define any mp3 as a ringtone, and transfer of files without the need of zune, it is ridiculous to have to use a bad program without being able to set things up the way I want!
__label__0 We cannot read___ more
__label__0 The developer portal is for developers.
__label__0 Currently the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter into account.
__label__1 Ads should start displaying in an app on the day it is published so the developer can generate revenue immediately.
__label__1 Therefore, it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two___ more
__label__0 The ListBox and MultiSelectList destroys and creates controls while scrolling up and down.
__label__1 It should be possible to deploy a UWP app inside the Edge browser as opposed to the App Store.

__label__0 This is unfair to devs and cheapens the Windows Store experience.
__label__0 I'm talking about this website:
__label__1 I would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also or may be give an advance search option where people can tell where the word should be searched.
__label__0 Without APIs you are losing customers to Android/iOS as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc.
__label__0 Is this new policy or is it a bug?
__label__1 Another solution could be simply extend Office Store in order to publish VSTO add-in.
__label__0 Also consider adding a group policy to enforce erasure.
__label__0 I can use a Silverlight player program (BitGravity Player is what I'm currently using), but it requires me to type an address in.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able stretch bing maps data a bit more (22-25) and for custom detailed TIleLayers it would be also great.
__label__1 3.- Share variables between applications in something that could be called Desharrapamientos instead of IsolatedStorageSettings.
__label__1 It would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in HTTP monitor tab.
__label__0 What does the Desktop Bridge do differently?
__label__1 Please allow us developers to access two dimensional array of bytes from the picture that is within the Image control.
__label__0 As available with their save tool: http://sky.mind.im/6301
__label__0 Not sure if that's YouTube only related, spotted it with YT.
__label__0 Why only have static country of registration there.
__label__1 Let the user choose between spit-screen or Anaglyph (Red-Cyan).
__label__0 HTTP stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone, that could be use for hosting webpage, downloading files from phone via browser etc
__label__1 Can we please improve the situation by adding missing API
__label__0 But if you go on the store using phone app, you don't see carriage return and white line between the sentences.
__label__0 [CDATA[ history.forward(); ]]></script> </button> <menuItems> <menuItem title=Forward position=0> <script><!
__label__0 We can access exif info (limited) using a Picture object when dealing with Media library.
__label__0 Start button for notification light .. Calls , msg, all notification
__label__0 Windows Phone 8 may have 3 new resolutions, but it only actually has two aspect ratios, 150% scaling and 160% scaling (accessible through App.Current.Host.Content.ScaleFactor).
__label__0 20000 km or so?
__label__1 Selecting Apps updated message in Windows Phone 8.1 notification center should jump directly to app download history, instead of jumping to the Store app but not showing the history.
__label__0 I've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help.
__label__0 * Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me… more
__label__0 Its on ios and Droid but not wp8.
__label__1 Market it more as a visual assistant.
__label__1 In Japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character.
__label__0 Even Universal App projects create multiple projects, one for Windows 8.1, another for Windows Phone 8.1 (neither of which support the previous, 8.0 versions of Windows, to note!)
__label__0 Hi, Instead of writing elaborate SyncML services, I would like to do the same using push notification like what is happening in iOS.
__label__0 This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because it's totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.
__label__1 Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this?
__label__1 I would like to see a single finger swipe across the entire navigation button area act as an app switch gesture.
__label__0 In order to listen to the podcast, I have to open the ogg file in a new tab and use the Firefox embedded plater/
__label__0 So flipbook sort of did this, but they did it awful and i unistalled.	
__label__0 Click ... expand menu.
__label__0 i.e feedly handles payment and delivery of information, creator creates information and receives revenue.
__label__0 Font weight in Button is not working at all.
__label__0 However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.
__label__1 It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.
__label__0 Currently it is impossible to pause in in-progress BackgroundTransferRequest.
__label__0 And I would gladly pay for that.Forcing a phone toy on my PC and forcing me to play technical wizard with other computer geeks is not the answer.
__label__0 Can you get them?
__label__0 Ability to tag friends on Facebook posts & in the Check In section of the people hub
__label__0 I saw new post and I confirmed that the problem was fixed following URL.
__label__0 You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on.___ more
__label__1 It would be much preferable to remove it from the Certificatio nprocess.
__label__1 It would be great if you would add a RemoteId to the calendars.
__label__0 No, much problem surfing later, I discover that I have to unpin the tab.
__label__0 Some times its hard to navigate few times to same location.
__label__0 When a notification appears, you have 3 options: swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area, or swipe the notification from bottom to up to ignore it, or press it to open the application related to the notification.
__label__0 it so happens that when you type or are playing a game, a slight touch either on the back or search button takes you out of context.
__label__0 Coming from webOS, navigation on wp8 feels very stilted.
__label__0 The documentation says to use the CookieContainer if one needs to save off HttpOnly cookies.
__label__0 Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.
__label__1 It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request) and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms.
__label__0 Application developers currently (pre-Mango) have no facilities to access the c contents of an incoming SMS message.
__label__0 Currently there is no way to collect console logs of an installed UWP app from xbox.
__label__0 I don't understand why if I search with the simple term as planner it does not show up.
__label__0 All to automate a sms-srvice.
__label__0 For example, you can customize the desktop version of the template provided in the TextBox Styles and Templates topic.
__label__0 Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.
__label__0 This would allow an app (quick view of calendar, twitter, or something else that could be sensitive) to be viewed quickly without having to login.
__label__1 It would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i.e I tell the user you have x appointments today - Would you like to review them ?
__label__0 So do I.
__label__0 Today I can't instantiate a Mappolygon in an ItemControl from XAML.
__label__0 This is a real problem.
__label__0 I don't know what that means.
__label__0 The {x:Static NumericConstant} way of accessing code page constants in XAML page already exists in WPF.
__label__0 Windows Phone(the phone NOT Zune) to have sort by name feature and not just date taken
__label__0 It is hard to hear since the sound of it is very low, but if the raw PCM stream is enhanced with WAV headers, so that the sound is Windows-playable, the bump turns out to be very noticeable.
__label__0 If a URL is required then either I have to use something like OneDrive which I think looks a bit unprofessional or I have to create a web page which requires hosting etc and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember.
__label__0 We were also able to switch between text messages and Facebook messages on the fly.
__label__1 Plz fix this.
__label__0 It's just the same like with mobile.
__label__0 It would save us a lot of time.
__label__0 Surprisingly NO ONE OF THEM supports Universal App implementation.
__label__0 I saw that ImageEx's fade animation doesn't allow developers to change duration and fixed to one second.
__label__0 There are tons of requests for this over the past years.
__label__0 I hope you like it.
__label__1 Please increase these limits (Maybe as an opt in).
__label__0 That xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and can____t be a separate file resource (can it?)
__label__0 There is an very old bug that is still present in Windows Phone 8 SDK: when a page has a control that inherits from ToggleButton (for example, CheckBox), System.IO.FileNotFoundException is thrown and shown in the Debug output.
__label__0 They said that use commerce.microsoft.com instead of formal invoice.
__label__0 Summa sumarum: Buy Launcher 8 or give us a way to customize the user Experience ourselves.
__label__0 App Hub_____________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________
__label__1 It would be really good to add parallel linq in windows phone and portable class libraries for collection processing unification and efficiency.
__label__0 Some of these users are dirtbags and send me garbage feedback like asdfasdfasdf.
__label__0 I went through the whole process again, but received the message that the alias was already in use.
__label__0 Right now WinAppDriver only works on desktop.
__label__0 When techbargain.com updated their site, it no longer worked with feedly.
__label__0 But he advised me to put a post here.
__label__0 User changes the language to Arabic (FlowDirection: RTL)
__label__0 It is possible to perform a search for the latitude and longitude of the place but this results in a pin that displays the latitude and longitude which can be confusing.
__label__0 iOS developers get this feature, so should Windows developers.
__label__0 There is no way for adding dns names in windows firewall and also it is not secure.
__label__0 When I send content from Feedly web to Evernote, the formatting comes across wonky and unclear.
__label__0 We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard (typically aids in drawing and ink based applications)
__label__1 It would be nice if you also ported the ads into UWP APIs so that they can be used with Desktop Bridge apps.
__label__1 Even there should be a option to delete the MPNS certificate .
__label__1 This is not really completely UWP related but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows 10 versions for testing purposes as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version.
__label__0 (NetworkInformation object not available etc.)
__label__0 I started as a sole developer, and now there's a group of us, and we are registered as a business with IRS.
__label__0 As long as it can't give me relevant search results, keep the darn thing away from my phone!
__label__1 M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it's just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.
__label__0 A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2359006-api-to-control-screen-brightness was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced.
__label__0 I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.
__label__0 its currently available at https://github.com/aL3891/ObservableDatabinding
__label__1 When in card view, it would be great to be able to close the running application either by swiping it away, using a cross to close it or whatever means, as having to enter one application and pressing the back button is time consuming and sometimes annoying
__label__0 However, when using a long list of Checkboxes within one of those lists, it randomly checks different checkboxes while scrolling.
__label__0 carrier billing) and not to credit card transactions in Windows Phone Store we are publishing the same apps in Windows Phone Store and Windows App Store.
__label__0 I am liking windows phone that I bought a couple of days ago but if I can't use the phone as my GPS navigation while driving, it's not good for me.
__label__1 Optionally, it would also be great for this capability to support selection of markets and price points that the app is intended to target.
__label__0 There are heaps and HEAPS of really good developers outside of US who really want to contribute to making Windows Phone a preferred choice, so please Microsoft; make___ more
__label__0 Creating a Modern Windows app can require creating a lot of project files, one one per platform type (Windows Phone 8.0, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.0, and Windows 8.1), with each project generating its own, unique output.
__label__1 Currently the Windows Phone and Windows Store merge as one, the Windows Dev Center App also need to update.

__label__1 Please provide a template for DX12 - XAML interop.
__label__0 When I create a paid app with a trial option, many users blow right by it because it doesn't show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free (via the trial).
__label__0 Seems like there is a problem with a popup, which seems to overlap the application bar.

The strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered.

I've observed it on bot - desktop and mobile UWP app.

More description and sample code you can find here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/33321971/2681948
__label__1 Please implement file upload API for Internet Explorer, so we can upload PDFs, Docs (from office hub), Images and Videos.
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time___ more
__label__0 Using the CreateRequestAsync method of UserCertificateEnrollmentManager and CertificateEnrollmentManager classes I noticed that the CertificatePropertiesCollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage OIDs (for example 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2 (SmartCard Logon) 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 (Secure E-Mail)) basic constraints (like Subject Type=End Entity or Path Length Constraint=none) nor the Subject Alternative Name (like RFC822 DS Object Guid ect).
__label__0 When I switch in IOS to another application (e.g. to translate a word) and switch back again the reader goes to a title page instead staying on the page I was reading, which is not pleasant.
__label__0 We can't use that at all.
__label__0 The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win32/WPF application and then Copy&Paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords.
__label__1 Add the ability to send the application for inclusion in the collection of applications store.

For example: I want to include my WinGeoChat application in the collection Apps for Work.
__label__1 Adding Disqus to the Windows Blog would be a great way to improve developer engagement and build the Windows Developer community.
__label__1 Enable 2D application developers to easily use 3D volumetric content in XAML/Composition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations.
__label__0 or at least distinct records (different taxes, sales Price, date time).
__label__0 To counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this won't be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the FutureAccessList before that.
__label__0 When I set Center with property or with TrySetViewAsync map changes altitude based on height of the object below
__label__1 I saw a TV Preview for a Show next week and I want to be reminded regarding this feed entry.
__label__1 OK, I realize that this is dependent on the carrier, but WP7 needs to support it if the carrier can offer it.
__label__0 Flipboard has a awesome way of doing it (but your RSS management is far better !)
__label__0 When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses.
__label__1 These APIs ought to be allowed for any UWP application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation:
__label__0 The total rating should be equal worldwide!
__label__0 I know that the Copyright for Apps schouldn't been touched, but what about the App to internal Memory and the needed files to microSD, to Support Phones with short internal Memory.
__label__0 In Windows Store the longer app's titles or capitalized app's titles for example COBATA (X)HTML Constructor are cut to 14-15 characters doing the app's title meaningless for example COBATA (X)HTML.
__label__0 How can I remove this limit so I could develop / end applications?
__label__1 Please allow private developers to access those capabilities.
__label__0 1) This limit is not in the [EmailMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.email.emailmessage) documentation.
__label__0 As of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications.
__label__1 Please remove the quotation marks or make Buffer post template editable like already the Twitter post template.

__label__1 Improve microsoft account login usability in app.
__label__0 Open a picture.
__label__0 The issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures.
__label__1 Update image control to support animated gifs.
__label__1 It just needs the /context command that returns the current context name which could be hard-coded as NATIVE_APP.
__label__0 Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited.
__label__1 Provide funtionality similar to CurrentAppSimulator class found in Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace.
__label__0 And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM)
__label__0 Can we know the platform on which app was purchased after app linking?
__label__1 Add UI element a/o shortcut to quickly add reference to default Evernote folder w/t popup dialog or confirmation.
__label__1 The old format of showing up to 8 screen shots side by side would give a user a better feel for the app as a whole.

__label__1 Make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application

__label__0 Follow touch enablement of mobile platforms and enable the list controls by default to have a tap top area that scrolls to top of list automatically.
__label__1 All I'm asking is when a new version of Windows 10 is released please keep the old VMs still in there.
__label__0 Hi, I really enjoy using feedly (Nextgen) on Windows Phone 8, and was excited to see the workflow with Onenote, which i already use for all my other note taking.
__label__0 Reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day.
__label__0 This would allow apps to say they were listening to KEXP instead only 93.1 and the station information as well.
__label__0 When looking at help & examples online while working on my code, I sometimes run into differences between WPF, Windows Runtime, and Silverlight but don't realize it right away, and end up frustrating myself until I do.
__label__0 Need capture all the http request or resource request, such as : http request in js, css, image resouces file_____ http request includes get or post request(url and body) While android and ios can do it.

__label__0 This supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the Group Header Template as well as that of the represented by the ItemTemplate.
__label__1 As an alternative to giving write-access to calendar (which can be hard to get a go on for security reasons), let us at least open an appointment directly in the calendar app.
__label__0 This is easily done with some reference data & SVG from Wikipedia.
__label__0 However there's an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching.
__label__0 LOL, everything was lost.
__label__1 When using a ListView bound to a CollectionViewSource with Grouped items it would be great to have the option to make the Grouped Item selectable/interactive.
__label__1 If white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible
__label__1 Optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide.
__label__1 Such a login process should not be allowed.
__label__0 In Windows Phone 8.

x, we had a nice photo auto-upload capability that allowed an app creator to tie into the camera and automatically upload each pic that the user took.
__label__0 Programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app.
__label__1 Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.
__label__0 The library being used by WP (HttpWebRequest) doesn't allow passing empty headers.
__label__0 In fact, how does one do it?
__label__0 SSDP (used in UPnP) relies on UDP multicast for discovery.
__label__0 The Smilies are displayed as colon, dash parentheses signs.
__label__0 I later found that the original submission had also been successful, even though it had hung, so that there were now two duplicate submissions in Processing Certification with slightly different aliases.
__label__0 Zunes could do it, so why did the Audible support get dropped before WP7?
__label__1 I would like to see the metadata be part of the project in VS.
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 If so, and there is no API to restrict usage for existing Windows Phone 7 app, but there will be an API to restrict functionality for Windows Phone 8 app, I may want to wait for Windows Phone 8 before deploying my app.
__label__1 I think MS needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using Windows 10s.
__label__0 The utm_ parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites.
__label__0 Think of foreign developers!
__label__0 This idea could be relatively simply achieved as a___ more

__label__0 Apple provides a similar capability via iTunes Connect (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/8_AddingNewApps/AddingNewApps.html).
__label__1 Similar to how Cortana handles text messages it would be nice if Cortana could draft an email onto Outlook for the iPhone.
__label__1 Make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers.
__label__0 But because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for___ more
__label__0 Language problem
__label__0 My friends know I'm developing for WP7 and the current stuff is embarrasing.
__label__0 Wouldn't be a good idea ?
__label__1 Please add windows update to default rules!!
__label__0 The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly:; When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.; Feedly's web app, however, keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it.
__label__0 This is the feature I miss the most from Android.
__label__0 Currently the Win2D DirectionalBlurEffect is marked as [NoComposition] and can't be used with Composition APIs both in the Creator's Update and the new insider builds for the Fall Creator's Update.
__label__1 for example I can add some text or anything I please on the side instating how far is this point to the current GPS location
__label__0 This is very powerful feature.
__label__0 For comparison I've… more
__label__0 The UWP scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background.
__label__0 Emulators are even slower than the WP7.1 ones, so the process is really long.
__label__0 I know it could be more plaisant, more colorfull, graphically improved, still better tuned to my real needs.
__label__0 I went through the whole process again, but received the message that the alias was already in use.
__label__1 Please revise that value to 12px or provide better representation solution.
__label__0 Forcing us to restart.
__label__0 Simply put, full swipe from right to left would swap to the next app in the back stack, while a full swipe from left to right would swap to the previous app in the back stack.
__label__1 It would be useful for creating more user-friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened.
__label__1 Do the minimum to create an instance of a TCP service and add a text attribute with a key-value pair
__label__0 Currently Periodic tasks have a 30min limit, Push Notifications won't wake up the phone.
__label__0 Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and a few Perf counters.
__label__1 Posibility to add new test users in real-time mode.
__label__0 The problem is it always provides the latest version only.
__label__1 For me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting/updating my app rather than having to provide a URL so I think this should be an option.
__label__0 I have a ListView with Grouped items.
__label__0 How we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update.
__label__0 Currently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account.
__label__0 Hi, I think it's useful if both windows phone 8.x and windows 8.x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465199.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464978.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.knownfolders.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj218966.aspx In particular, having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API doesn't deliver a UX on par with other platforms.
__label__1 It would be much preferable to remove it from the Certificatio nprocess.
__label__1 Make a Chrome packaged app for Feedly please.
__label__0 There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first 38 characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit.
__label__1 Better marketplace - I would like a new UI 9.
__label__0 We live in a connected world.
__label__0 But in my case i want to print receipt and don't want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer.
__label__0 There does not seem to be a way to control newlines in the application descriptions on the Marketplace.
__label__1 Local MultiScaleImage functionality is available on iPhone so please do not put WP7 developers at a disadvantage.
__label__1 Allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond pay/free/top/new by adding filter by rating (ex: 4+), by price (ex: <$1.99), by number of downloads (ex: 10000+), or allow blacklisting of developers (or developer rankings) so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided.
__label__0 I could hear my music become intermittently.
__label__1 As a Windows app consumer, I want to be able to search for apps by name, so that I can find and download the specific app I am looking for.
__label__0 There would be no reason to ever learn another language/platform paradigm.
__label__0 Currently in D2D for Windows Phone ID2D1Factory::CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget is strangely not supported.
__label__0 That means: - Custom Markup Extensions - XamlServices.Load and Save _____ more
__label__1 Wish there was a way for mails, contacts,calendars etc to be pulled from an OWA URL into the email account definitions.
__label__0 If iOS and Android can do it why can't Windows Phone?
__label__0 In trying to develop a custom playlist application, it is apparent that it is impossible to integrate the BackgroudAudioPlayer with the XNA.MediaLibrary.
__label__0 This is contrary to the docs and to expected behavior.
__label__0 It plays a big role in education, helping visually impaired etc.
__label__1 I wish you add the capability to Add or Remove MediaLibrary.Songs or modify current MediaPlayer.Queue via code.
__label__0 Integration with other social media so I can read all the latest tweets, google+ updates and others from with the feedly app.
__label__0 Firstly, deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc. from Microsoft when the app users won't even be the general public.
__label__1 Now we want to bundle these Apps.
__label__0 Is that be design?
__label__0 I hope to contribute, to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone.
__label__0 Are you planning to advertise your company products or discount news by online videos?
__label__0 This is way more Adobe's UI problem than yours.
__label__1 Format the text with a specific number of decimal place (i.e.
__label__0 For example, timer and alarm apps.
__label__0 make the mapicon of the windows phone sdk 8.1 able to be on top by the use of zindex make the event tapped accessible for mapicon too
__label__0 AS developing XNA apps in Windows Phone 8 development will not be supported anymore , we sometimes need to have 3d Models and work with them inside application without need to learn C++ & Direct X which will take alot of time and maybe valuable for game developers only .
__label__1 Please give us API for TFS so we can connect to TFS server, see all our projects and users, manage tasks, manage code versioning and etc.
__label__1 Please please incorporate this in future release.
__label__0 I couldn't find anything in the release notes about this change.
__label__0 - Extensions don't work consistently on various versions/builds of Windows.
__label__0 I notice it is already available to the user in the 7.1 version (Mango) but I don't see methods in the API for scanning to the next signal (or seeking, whatever the term is called).
__label__0 In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.
__label__0 If so then this issue should concern you as a developer.
__label__1 Raise single events (but it's bad for performance)
__label__0 can then redisplay the app in a special section of the market.
__label__1 Lockscreen: -Should be able to chose a tiny black outline around lettering so you can see what's written properly when you have a Clear/White lock screen.
__label__0 The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were___ more
__label__1 It would be great if I could display an option to lock the screen, which would basically lock the screen, but show my own page as the lock screen.
__label__0 The unknown error also happens on build 17713 and I'm curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release?
__label__0 finger lifts up from screen).
__label__0 I cannot port my Windows Phone Silverlight App to UWP because it is depending on the Panorama Control which is missing in UWP.
__label__0 This is what I am currently using
__label__1 After releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top (as a simple list do) and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the Refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visibility (i would prefer this one)
__label__0 I cannot, for example, highlight a friend when I'm trying to tell something to him in my post.
__label__0 I dont like typing on this keyboard and its not correcting all the time like right now.
__label__0 Currently, serialization and deserialization of the CookieContainer doesn't work.
__label__0 Now that beta apps do not expire, we, the developers need a way to force remove a beta app from devices or remove access for certain users.
__label__0 The same is true for applications and the OS itself.
__label__1 In UWP Project follow XAML code make a Win32 Exception when minimum target is build16299.
__label__0 BTW - seems that FutureAccessList sometimes has bugs and people are leaving platform and… more
__label__0 The CommandBar in the Page body works as expected.
__label__0 Windows Phone is an amazing media consumption device, and bringing audiobooks back into the Zune fold would make it that much better.
__label__1 We need a way to have a system wide overlay notification.
__label__0 Where can I vote for showing sales up to limit 200 USD?
__label__0 BeeLine Reader (full disclosure: I'm the founder) has browser plugins that apply eye-guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier.
__label__0 We are presently working on a WP8 version of an app to play sign language videos, but are stymied by this restriction.
__label__1 Microsoft should do approach with developer aplication service and makers of office space in order to them to make the aplication run on Windows Phone 7, 7.5, 7.8, 8, 8.1 for all brand (Nokia, HTC, Samsung etc)
__label__1 Prevent full-trust apps from targeting phone and Xbox if you have to.
__label__0 In todays criminal/government spy world, simply flagging a file as deleted does not secure it from prying eyes.
__label__0 Now uninstalling apps also is not of much use....a reset needs to be done.
__label__0 Basic scenario is the need to store set of secret API keys for various 3-rd party APIs (twitter for example).
__label__0 CharacterCasing has been added to the platform but it seems to only be used on editable text controls.
__label__0 Sometimes, when I am reading a feed and I want to share it directly with a person, it is very easy to to push it to someone.
__label__1 Please provide an API for usb communication on Windows Phone.

My ideia consists in make a client-server program to emulate commands on the Windows Phone (key events, touch events, lauch apps, etc) via another device.
__label__1 Could a Smart dial please be finally applied to the phone app?
__label__0 I can only scan qrcode , access link to download it.
__label__1 Ensure that the target device screen is unlocked and that the application is installed.
__label__1 Raise reset event
__label__0 To make it possible to actually find an app by its title.
__label__0 I'm a developer trying to make a Discord app for Windows Phone Windows Tablet Xbox and HoloLens.
__label__0 Of course, we have iOS and Android versions that work on phones.
__label__0 The requirements that involve phone calls, text messages, and zune hub music are all impossible to test from within the emulator.
__label__0 Unless of course we go with a predetermined SongCollection such as SongCollection limitedPlaylist = new MediaLibrary.Songs; This stops the ability to create custom playlists.
__label__0 It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names.
__label__0 It's a bit dull to have nearly all tiles the same colour.
__label__0 For example, my app is currently fairly well reviewed (4.5 stars).
__label__0 currently, APP can only access them through Office.
__label__0 Azure support system is a very good example how this should work.
__label__1 I would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures.
__label__0 I use WP7 on fido, each time I sent SMS the SMS get the proper time stamp, however when I receive SMS the timestamp is -5:00 hours, can you guys add a feature to fix this issue.
__label__0 Currently we have Access to external mass storage.
__label__0 So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a rating/reviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app.
__label__0 This is really way too long in UWP Xaml not addressed.
__label__0 A collegue of mine , with an Android Smartphone has just showed me on this Phone an Android Launcher called --> Launcher 8 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lx.launcher8 What I saw was a Windows Look and Feel and much, much more functionality than my Windows 8 Nokia Lumia has.
__label__0 Please vote so that this issue get addressed.
__label__1 This needs fixing as a number 1 priority.
__label__0 Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.
__label__1 It would be nice to give developers the option put a payment on hold when they reach the appropriate threshold and have the option to put it on top of the next due payment when they reach the threshold after that.
__label__0 I recently browsed the UWP docs and found some interesting APIs about Accessory Management etc.
__label__1 Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.
__label__1 Starting a project for a UWP is really hard.
__label__0 2) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).
__label__0 I also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to MS directly.
__label__0 For comparison I've tested this on Bonjour Avahi and Android's Network Service Discovery and they all handle this case correctly.
__label__0 8.1, German localization
__label__0 Haciendo que el celular del lumia 900 se pueda utilizar como almacenamiento masivo como cualquier otro celular :@
__label__0 Don't know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works.
__label__0 For example Share glyph - 0xE72D - is not enumerated.
__label__0 In every communication emails the support officer's manager and generic escalation emails are included.
__label__0 This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because it's totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.
__label__1 support chinese
__label__0 Or reply to the suggestions with reason why its not possible.
__label__0 Altough there are app like office, acrobet reader and many 3rd party apps which handles the particular content-type.
__label__0 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________wp___
__label__0 I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.
__label__1 We need this also in Windows App Store because: 1.
__label__0 I'm using the OnlineIdAuthenticator instead of the LiveSDK because it's API references that I would be able to always show a UI to prompt the user to enter their credentials by setting the CredentialPromptType to RetypeCredentials.
__label__0 NinJamp for platform Windows Phone
__label__0 E.g. I read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article.
__label__1 Can't the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than SystemPolicy (ApplicationClosing ApplicationSuspended...)?
__label__0 Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera, Messaging etc
__label__0 I'm trying to use the API for Contacts in the namespace Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts, but it doesn't work as expected.
__label__0 open in new external browser tab;
__label__0 So, I had this great idea for an app... Got a good chunk of it coded, then found out that SmsComposeTask doesn't have the ability to attach images as an MMS.
__label__0 Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.
__label__0 I had to hold power button with volume down button in order to shut device off and reboot.
__label__0 Like Qemu in Windows mobile
__label__0 Link to related App Hub suggestion: http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/p/74377/453077.aspx#453077 Link to related Connect Issue: https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/641068/multiline-text-input-on-windows-phone I thought I had raised this as a platform request, but seems it's showing up in Feature Feedback instead.
__label__1 Please fix this by updating the manifest.json file inside the app.
__label__1 Please get back the old OneDrive integration to windows phone 8.1.
__label__0 So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:
__label__0 I can not develop, because I can not transfer more than three applications for AppHub.
__label__1 The second insight I would like to provide for feedback is on the Cortana's speech recognition on Apple iOS and Android and user input.
__label__0 Even if mediaplayer does not contains copyrighted media (phone recorded video), it is not possible to capture its content.
__label__0 The ability to have video on Live Tiles.
__label__1 When declaring a custom Template for ContentDialog the template root must contain a Border with x:Name=Container otherwise the ShowAsync method will throw a System.AccessViolationException.
__label__0 This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the 'master' account name and password with lots of people thus removing any value of using AD federation.
__label__0 Just as simple as it sounds, gifting an app to someone else with a Windows device.
__label__1 Microsoft already allow developers to use the Bing Maps API in their API, so i realy hope they consider opening up the Bing APIs for the coming Tango/Apollo dev toolsets.
__label__0 This happens when you try to scroll beyond the bounds of the control and there is the elastic effect which allows you to move the page beyond the border of the control.
__label__1 It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.
__label__0 There is no possibility to choose a specific port number.
__label__0 Currently UWP can't open WASAPI output devices in capture mode due to COM restrictions.
__label__0 If the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus.
__label__1 Suggestion for Pathicon DataUri Property for loading PathIcon from a Svg File instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff (F1 M 1612 202L 2016 116) in their xaml.
__label__0 The API is fine but where I'm running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event.
__label__0 <video src=http://mlmidev.webcastcenter.com/mlm/idev.isml/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8></video> It works on iOS, Android 3+, and Apple computers with Safari.
__label__1 Improve its data base and functionality.
__label__0 I have spent an entire day trying to get something anything working.
__label__0 Not only will this benefit both Microsoft and Samsung but put more power into the hands of the users and developers of both (which are many many people).
__label__0 I've asked the support, they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account, and after it, ask them to migrate apps and related data.
__label__0 But I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.
__label__1 -Should be able to put transparent (saved in PGN) lockscreens like WP7.5 Notification Center: -Should be able to control the screen when notification center is half open.
__label__1 Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see, it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed.
__label__0 Why cant Windows Phone do this?
__label__1 Developers should be able to create WP images that are tailored to be in a specific state, and manage those image snapshots.
__label__0 But as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform.
__label__0 960x1280 Now check the properties of wbmp: PixelWidth: 960 PixelHeight: 1280 PixelBuffer.Length: 1228800 The length of PixelBuffer is totally wrong, the buffer size shoud be 960 x 1280 x 4 = 4915200 The wrong value 1228800 comes from the original size: 480 x 640 x 4.
__label__0 In addition to being able to search on the internet SVG animated icons ready to use.
__label__0 On many systems (probably the slower ones) the scrolling behavior is very odd.
__label__0 I set the background to a fixed color (black) in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by Windows Phone automatically, hence no text is readable.
__label__1 I think Microsoft needs to re-consider about having splash screens.
__label__0 At the moment there are only APIs for reading and writing NFC Tags.
__label__0 Currently it seems to be sorted by Unicode code points which doesn't make any sense for Chinese characters at least.
__label__0 The same way that control panel does.
__label__1 Hey Guys....people love universal search in windows 8.1 why don't u try to make it universal for search button on windows phone
__label__0 It's extremely annoying.
__label__0 Currently we have Access to external mass storage.
__label__0 I am using Microsoft's DNS-SD which aims to implement the Zeroconf standard RFC 6763. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763
__label__0 Can't really use my Omnia 7 untill volume update :( Media volume on Omnia 7 is fine, not as loud as I would prefer but good enough I can hear people hardly when calling mobile or landline but when calling international numbers it's just not possible to hear what people says.
__label__0 I currently have WP8 SDK installed and I am not able to get the emulator working consistently.
__label__0 If you request an offset for a location that is outside of the visible map portion, the returned point is not computed using the same Dpi than a location which lie inside of the visible portion of the map.
__label__0 Apple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016.
__label__0 I think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue.
__label__0 On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025 but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing.
__label__0 http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj681688(v=vs.105).aspx
__label__0 Right now it's possible to define apps for websites using app URI handlers.
__label__0 The rate is set to 1-1.
__label__0 In theory it is allowed.
__label__1 Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.
__label__1 The launching application should be allowed to send information to the launched application via query strings.
__label__0 It makes getting around the city so much easier.
__label__0 Here_____ more
__label__0 With SuppressSystemOverlays you can still force the status bar to show using StatusBar.ShowAsync.
__label__1 Please allow that API in in background.
__label__0 I noticed that Buffer and Evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the Web interface.
__label__0 It might happen that app can have so many reviews on other_____ more
__label__0 But we can certainly attempt this for you.
__label__0 To provide lockscreen text its necessary to use the WideBackContent attribute on the Flip tile.
__label__0 Once access to a user___s podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled, developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience.
__label__0 Recently the 'visit website' launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything.
__label__1 Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.
__label__0 It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.
__label__0 So both SP and TM do legal operations (they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time)
__label__0 Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases.
__label__0 Now let's say you have two other libs, B and C, and both of these depend on A.
__label__0 Now uninstalling apps also is not of much use....a reset needs to be done.
__label__0 Checkbox to add additional fee of 13.9% on top of the normal Store Fee (percentage of Net Receipts) that is deducted in calculating our Application Proceeds for these markets: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa.
__label__1 The possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for in-process with C# and/or VB.net instead of C++.
__label__1 Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want.

__label__0 I have read that you did have tumblr integration and then it was gone.	
__label__0 
Provision to play a Audio/Video to multiple devices connected in same network or network segment.


__label__0 In some case if enterprise wants its signed app to be installed using In house Touch Kiosk(PC/MACHINE) then this should be possible using USB installation.
__label__0 Right now the APIs only allow recognition of text input.
__label__0 It seemed like for a few days, Feedly was using Chrome Custom tabs instead of opening links in the external Chrome app.
__label__1 If you build it it would be great if you could add configurable close-functionality to the tab-header that is bindable to a ViewModel.
__label__0 Maybe by having a frequency parameter so for each of the existing RecurrenceType types (i.e.
__label__0 The WebView control doesn't allow printing embedded PDFs etc.
__label__0 I have been building computers and my first was a dos and i played game'son it.
__label__0 The problem is of following nature: as i amreading a long corespondence mail, with multiple reply to all's, when i press the back button, screen goes black, does not go back to mailbox view.
__label__0 This problem happens randomly.
__label__0 I didn’t find the option.
__label__0 2 Hot plug device to unit and idle about 1min
__label__0 Not all of us are the Instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get.
__label__0 4 - Do the same for Styles.xaml (or whatever file contains Templates and Styles) as done in 1.
__label__1 Could the same be added to Safari.
__label__0 E.g.
__label__1 You should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance.
__label__0 I can login into my account for the past 3 days.	
__label__0 CoreIndependentInputSource has it's own Dispatcher does that mean it has it's own HWND/message queue?
__label__0 The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes (all covered by unit tests).
__label__0 In more detailed/extremely simplified: What about having an app that rotates an image, an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer.
__label__0 If the phone is stolen, and it is password locked, it's still possible to take photos (if enabled).
__label__1 Right now it takes 2 clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket, it would be nice if it's handled in the same window with pop-up , or just with single click.	
__label__0 In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric.
__label__0 These are valid only on the device on which they were created, so the only phone you'd brick would be your dev-unlocked own.
__label__0 In our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx.
__label__0 Suppose I want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with.
__label__1 This would also be very nice so that you could add a 'create playlist' feature into the music+video hub.
__label__1 I think that would be useful if we can get the number of reviews and avarage rating by country in the Dev Center Report.
__label__0 Seems that it is waiting to receive credential but no popup is showed.
__label__0 Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots.
__label__0 -applications use the API of the Hub message for send/view/delete/etc... SMS -The message Hub uses the API of others applications for the same thing (send/view/delete/etc... messages).
__label__0 Supports natively playing a playlist as an input ie a collection of URIs
__label__1 The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win32/WPF application and then Copy&Paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords.
__label__0 It is needed when displaying text on pictures.
__label__0 How?
__label__1 Allow license assignment for an application to be tied to Azure AD group similar to how licenses in Office 365 can be managed.
__label__0 As it is, Indie Developers have lost confidence in Microsoft efforts in PubCentre/Bing Ads and are moving to different Ad controls, and investing into Android and iOS Platforms until Microsoft starts to demonstrate that it is serious about providing revenue performant Adversting services.
__label__0 Like me I wanna to do that things which I've done in my Windows 7, Like change icons, add more colors of tiles which are not available in list.
__label__0 I understand you have security considerations to consider, however i cannot think of any reason we should not be able to check if a sms is received.
__label__0 On Windows Phone 8.1, the store bug : when we open the store, applications list coudn't load.
__label__0 (I tried PowerShell scripts using WMI such as http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/get-hyper-v-windows-server-2012-guest-network-configuration-using-wmi/ ) See https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ce23adc6-53a0-44c6-8e75-7b57a33ebe84/uwp-how-to-programmatically-deploy-appx-to-win-10-mobile-emulator?forum=wpdevelop There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.
__label__0 But unfortunately, this is application wide, and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included.
__label__0 For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare, UL, ULC, Calypso, Desfire, maybe even more) I've read that for WP8.1 the functionality will be___ more
__label__0 To support validation, one option is to re-template the controls to provide your own validation template.
__label__1 Add LoginHint as optional param to LoginAsync() and plumb through GetUserTokenV2Async.
__label__1 Recommendation: add a parameter to ShowAsync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app (centered left right bottom).
__label__0 On Windows 8.1 / RT 8.1 che call to the PickContactAsync() works but I receive wrong data instaed, for example: FirstName and LastName are both in FirstName (and LastName is empty), the ImportantDates (e.g.
__label__0 However since phones are becoming more and more like PCs used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear, like the Structure Sensor which is designed to work with IPhone and Android.
__label__0 It was easy to integrate with Google Reader.
__label__1 It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.
__label__0 For example, logging GPS___ more
__label__0 Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially___ more
__label__0 our question is would converting our app to use newer windows ink code (forgive my lack of knowledge here) and if… more
__label__0 This way the app is very robust and flexible.
__label__0 Hope this issue lands in the priority list of Microsoft.
__label__0 Read email access Locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for UWP apps.

__label__0 But at the Moment there is no way to get the setting the user made in the Phone settings.
__label__0 Does Microsoft really NOT support local database in developing Universal App?
__label__1 This info should be mandatory IMHO.
__label__0 Unfortunately it looks like the UI components (in this case a ListBox) cannot deal with the .Add and *multiple items*.
__label__0 It has become difficult to both know what key you need to press and get the timing of the press correct to be able to access your BIOS.
__label__0 Currently, there doesn't seem to be any possibility to disable the bounce effect when scrolling inside the WebBrowser control which makes any apps based in HTML5 look and feel cheap.
__label__0 There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete/remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center.

__label__0 Something like: - call completed - call cancelled - call failed and on the arguments some information like call duration Thank you so much for this chance!
__label__0 Do you think it can work this way?
__label__0 DataPackage.OperationCompleted is not raised (at least when pasting text).
__label__1 Provide access to the podcast episodes that are in the media library so that they may be used to construct, for instance, custom playlists.
__label__0 e.g: Represents the I<sup>2</sup> C controller for the system
__label__1 (If you are also using PInvoke.Kernel32.dll please install the nuget-package directly to the UWP-project automatic references added by other nuget-packages like PCLCrypto add an older version verify the version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll in your bin/x86/Debug build output folder it should be at least 0.5.147.53150)
__label__0 When this issue specified test features.
__label__0 It's not about aesthetics Visualfeedback kills performance the framerate in games drops by half which is ironic if you think that's the kind of apps CoreIndependentInputSource was created for in the first place.
__label__0 Sometimes phone is getting stucked while unlocking phone on my HTC 8S.
__label__1 I'd like to see a way for any UWP app to opt-in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot.
__label__0 (Ofcourse I'm using Windwos 10 Creators Update Version.)
__label__0 I have a question related… more
__label__1 For this I would like an user id (anonymous) so my data move to my other phones and delete from phones without logged in live account.
__label__1 Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.
__label__0 The same with old stlye Binding works fine
__label__0 Feedly is a website.
__label__0 If the point is outside, we have to divide the result by RawPixelsPerViewPixel.
__label__0 Apps that use the webview aren't able to login to Feedly.
__label__1 Ideally I would like to see a graph with both #of purchases and purchase price plotted against time, this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase vs price.
__label__0 Hi!
__label__0 SO, if i can lock my phone through windowsphone.com why cant i unlock it the same way when i forget my password?
__label__1 Hey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/PC
__label__0 This would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device.
__label__0 I make Themes for Nokia, Android and blackBerry and If WP7 will have Themes more personalizable like Symbian with a Software to make these, will be perfect!
__label__1 Please make the control usable in an app.
__label__0 This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area.
__label__0 Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP)
__label__0 The vast majority of the documentation for the APIs is auto-generated descriptions of classes, interfaces and so on.

There is practically no documentation on how classes, class clusters and sub-systems should or do work.
__label__0 Then when you move the screen it will not have the same problem.
__label__0 Please consider it.
__label__0 The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF.
__label__1 I would propose adding the ability for the SplitView pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen.
__label__0 When a developer opened a developer account, Microsoft doesn't issue business invoice for registration fee.

They said that use commerce.microsoft.com instead of formal invoice.

Have you ever seen the invoice in the commerce.microsoft.com?
__label__0 Thus one has to manually dig through MSDN to find the correct signature.
__label__0 Because we calculate our prices in ___ we___ more
__label__0 It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.
__label__0 With other words: it sucks!
__label__1 Adding Visibility property on Expander and making the header Invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view.
__label__0 I know this will be simple just edit the style but I can't make it right
__label__1 Add a tile view like in old Windows 8.1 Store.
__label__1 I'd also be happy if MapTileSource property changes (like Bounds) were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back (this is how it can be done currently).
__label__0 When you click on something in IE9 it overlays it with a gray box.
__label__0 This means loopback auto capture is not supported.
__label__0 I can use a Silverlight player program (BitGravity Player is what I'm currently using), but it requires me to type an address in.
__label__0 That would make it great for devs who start building with Windows platform first and wanna bring to other platforms.
__label__0 you can make it.
__label__1 Switch the default to LF style line endings in the whole operating system!
__label__0 Exactly as the title says.
__label__0 Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right (as if dragging the item to the left revealing options behind it.
__label__0 Big asks are asks are … more
__label__1 Allow changing of volume in the Windows Device Portal.
__label__1 Either fix it or make Feedly work always-on without browser interference.
__label__0 When I send it from other similar tools like Mr Reader, it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website.
__label__0 On the Windows phone website, my account shows ALL the apps I downloaded, but after resetting my phone, I was forced to remember which ones were useful vs useless...
__label__0 that the Store team needs to ingest the app and provide it to the store.
__label__0 Checkboxes to select multiple contacts when sending messages or adding to a group.
__label__0 I know it works in IE 10 now, not sure about 9 but definately not 8.
__label__0 UX is much better and
__label__0 For instance instagram, vimeo videos.
__label__0 Now in SDK 7.1 it is possible to record audio by using the AudioSink Silverligh class, so we don't need to trick the system by using the XNA loop, but when using this class the tag <Capability Name=ID_CAP_CAMERA/> should be present at WMAppManifest.xml file, but we are only using microphone.
__label__0 Possibly some other property named parent to choose where popup is revealed from.
__label__0 So Microphone.SampleRate property just returns this fixed value.
__label__1 Just looking for an option that let's me list my articles from oldest to newest like I have it in the on the site.
__label__0 In short, if low bandwidth MMOs_____ more
__label__0 Native video player and support for subtitle If I am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file (.srt).
__label__0 Something like http://livetiles.co.uk/Beta/Default.html but from MS, perhaps a part of http://www.windowsphone.com/marketplace ?
__label__0 Since today I cannot send to Instapaper anymore, which was very useful for me.
__label__0 we have installed some certificates from sbs exchange-servers.
__label__1 The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary or Secondary button in a ContentDialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned - otherwise x:Bind bindings wont update.
__label__0 100% of my blogs are music blogs and i'd say 75% of posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them.
__label__0 The problem is probably when the app tryies to access BackgroundMediaPlayer.Current in IBackgrounTask.Run method - it fires the background task once again, what shouldn't happen.
__label__0 Despite being built to appear as a single-page app clicking pretty much any link in Dev Dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns.
__label__0 It would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all!
__label__0 In Windows Phone 8 we were able directly access facebook through the people hub.
__label__1 If you're using Feedly as your homepage, a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice.
__label__0 If my goal is optimal performance, I must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low-level queries and data structures.
__label__0 Some other Nokia apps that were installed by default when I bought the phone (photo and video related apps) were not restored either.
__label__0 At the moment a VSTO add-in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store.
__label__0 This would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download.
__label__0  at System.Management.Automation.WildcardPattern.IsMatch(String input)
__label__0 For example, I needed to rebrand one of my apps, and while it appears under its new name in Marketplace, I can't change it to the new name in App Hub.
__label__0 One solution would be that XAML finally switches to Direct2D for the rendering of shapes and controls.
__label__0 I currently use gRead widget to see my unread count on Google Reader.
__label__1 Please implement.
__label__0 I want Feedly to be bigger!!!!!!!
__label__0 ;)
__label__1 It would be great if I could have two WebView each having a different user profile.
__label__1 I think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didn't view, just like android and IOS, but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn WiFi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have 2.
__label__0 Often I have little time and just want to scan headlines, and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile.
__label__0 Native support of SVG animation with SMIL inside XAML for Beautiful and Responsive UI and Hardware acceleration backend on OpenGL/Direct3D/Vulkan/Metal.
__label__0 The function would get the original text and is expected to return either XAML objects or maybe a more abstract of representation of colored text which is then handled by… more
__label__0 But I'm missing that list animations seen on Settings or Messaging apps when opening or closing them.
__label__0 It is working correct with .mp3 and other codecs but not with FLAC.
__label__0 Incremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit.
__label__1 Create a separate registration/login system independent of a Google account.
__label__0 Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.
__label__0 In order to reproduce it, one should just try to record an audio on the WP device (not an emulator), have it's code add WAV headers to the audio stream and save it to an isolated storage.
__label__0 Warning C6386
__label__0 b) It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders.
__label__0 This bug more description and the code to reproduce it can be found in this blogpost:
__label__1 can you add a new property in OCR library so that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written in?
__label__0 It'll save you a lot of typing, looking for controls and types etc.
__label__0 Unfortunately, in the current situation, I can't have the best of both worlds.
__label__1 Change search engine of internet explorer, etc.
__label__0 CharacterCasing has been added to the platform but it seems to only be used on editable text controls.
__label__0 Today I have run into a problem with ComboBox control.

The issue can be easily reproduced: I have two rows and two columns.

Left column takes as much space as possible and I place the ComboBox into the right column.

I populate the ComboBox with a few items and run the app.

I maximize the window, open the ComboBox popup (selection menu), minimize and I see the popup moved to the middle of the window.
__label__0 Offcourse the api can throw CommandNotFoundException.
__label__1 Use Cases: Allow 3rd party access to ringer settings.
__label__0 Once again, these problems DO NOT happen on WP7.5 so I'd like to see if these are known issues on WP8 OS and hope to see the fix soon.
__label__0 So long as the user must explicitally accept the use of teh app in the background, then why is it an issue.
__label__0 And then I remind myself that this is just on the SD card.
__label__1 If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implications… more
__label__0 I don’t know what the component should look like.
__label__0 I know we can pass string in the URI but come on we are creating native apps not web apps that we should be limited to this way of coding.
__label__0 When typing in the What's New text area a message Release notes can’t be more than 1500 characters with a red (X) glyph appears when you reach 1458 characters.
__label__0 I was able to finally build an app package that I can manually move o the device in the portal but I shouldn't have to do that and it breaks the debug chain.
__label__0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3ucr7o91uw0h5/Ideas.pptx Please see this
__label__0 Included with biometric framework out-of-box supply facial recognition module using front facing camera.
__label__1 As an alternative to that, you could also create a 1x1 widget mimicking the app icon with unread counter.
__label__1 I think you need to make a different notification area.
__label__0 When developing Coded UI test for a localized UWP apps, test becomes dependent on texts that are localized.

On most controls this can easily be handled by an AutomationId, but on the CoreWindow and MessageBox (incl.
__label__0 private/corporate WiFi authentication with a certificate is not supported at Mango.
__label__0 I think only software update require..
__label__0 I'm okay with a friendly warning perhaps a glyph replacement?
__label__0 I bought my WP7 phone with gaming in mind, but there's more than one gamer in this house -___ more
__label__0 I don't know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it… more
__label__0 ...instead of low/mid/high
__label__0 They should___ more
__label__0 The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand.
__label__1 It was good if we could set the app or in-app product to be free for one day for example and return back after that.
__label__1 We need a way to save videos to the camera roll.
__label__0 http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication
__label__1 But it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case there's isn't enough space on the tile.
__label__1 I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows 7 but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows 10 before writing apps for it.

__label__0 Not good.
__label__0 Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing be working?
__label__0 I am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact's details and re-create them in your own UI... which would be great if the API exposed all of the user's details (like the Anniversary) which it does not.
__label__0 represents a control that contains audio and / or video.
__label__1 Also as a secondary request... let FolderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation also be a FolderRelativeId
__label__1 Create Delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious.com
__label__0 Feedly is really bad at discovering feeds when given only the URL.
__label__1 Can we have a sortable observable collection for WP7?
__label__0 Without that, we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.
__label__0 2 - I use SettingsFlyouts and I took some time to replicate them as pages in the Windows Phone project.
__label__0 Game of Thrones is on the Windows Store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic  scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered.
__label__0 API uses a WebView-based auth.
__label__0 For line of business applications processing large datasets.
__label__0 At the moment, when launching the BingMapsTask it's only possible to set the center and zoom level.
__label__1 For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits.
__label__0 If your font foreground in white and there are white elements in the picture the text gets lost.
__label__0 Intel says they cannot Give update.
__label__0 As above
__label__0 Also if I create a contact in the ContactStore then search contacts it returns the ones ive created, but there is no extended properties that will enable me to know ive created it in my custom store.
__label__1 Enable FM scan function in the developer API.
__label__0 Then copy it to a Windows environment to play in media player.
__label__0 actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid)
__label__0 The event arguments from the AddressChooserTask only returns the contact address as a string.
__label__0 Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation.
__label__0 word, excel and powerpoint basically).
__label__0 Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit?
__label__1 Update the WPDEV feedback app.
__label__1 Make AutoSuggestBox supports AutomationProperties for test automations and accessibility.
__label__0 buttons) you cannot set any AutomationId____s so the coded UI test has the use the title to find the elements.
__label__0 My app users are reporting that they can't get information about my durable add-on on the Xbox One and Xbox One S.
__label__0 You have a group of friends with send my favorite post writing command.
__label__0 catch (LiveConnectException ex) { // Display another error message. }
__label__0 The problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content:
__label__0 _________________________________ON/OFF________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________
__label__1 It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request) and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms.
__label__0 When browsing a site with RSS and ATOM metadata header, the Chroma and Firefox plugin presents a transparent button to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to Feedly.
__label__1 Allow the international developer to pay the Account Registration through PayPal or others ways, as the local Microsoft office.
__label__1 Please bring back the simplicity and efficiency of Windows Phone!
__label__0 My Name is Yury Shetov.
__label__0 There are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack.
__label__0 Also, after I restored the phone, Here Maps and Here Drive+ tiles had !
__label__1 Please add an Azure Developer VM for Windows with Unity.
__label__0 We don't need VS Express and everything from Windows 7 SDK.
__label__0 However, Internet Explorer doesn't let us upload anything!
__label__0 the moment I open a video, the sound's played back using the devices back speakers??
__label__1 Please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature.
__label__0 I don't believe that there is not ADO.NET!
__label__0 I have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks, and when I tried to implement scheduling I was surprised to see that this is not available on Windows.
__label__1 If it is indeed possible, maybe a short how-to in the help section is in order?
__label__1 Allow entering decimal values
__label__0 First word works.

Next word doesn't work, but only adds a space Second attempt works.
__label__0 [Universal App] It was installed on the SD directly.
__label__1 Could you add support of Xamarin.Forms to the Project Rome SDK?
__label__0 Some WP7 phone (not the AT&T Samsung Focus) have a never screen timeout.
__label__0 In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.
__label__0 I have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that I want to follow, including my own.
__label__0 For example app submission/certification gives you There was a problem processing this request.
__label__1 Let the user choose between spit-screen or Anaglyph (Red-Cyan).
__label__0 Even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button.
__label__0 For comparison I've tested this on Bonjour Avahi and Android's Network Service Discovery and they all handle this case correctly.
__label__0 Hi, I am a developer aplications, and even have done some projects for the university.
__label__0 The actual erasure can be a background process.
__label__0 Other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full.
__label__1 Ada 2012 has the ability to express pre- and post-conditions and add them in an easy manner; if these were to be put into the APIs you could block erroneous data from being passed into the API's function which in turn should make things more stable (or at least give more meaningful error-messages than 0x80072f8f 0x800f0906 0xc004f074 and the like).
__label__0 You could consider doing the same.
__label__1 A better manipulation of exif APIs will be very helpfull.
__label__0 best regards and a happy new year 2014 Karsten Klein
__label__0 All I am able to control at the moment is the contrast of the display (by playing with the colours and alpha levels of the rendered graphics).
__label__1 This should also be fixed in the WP7 SDK (where all page templates, including the Pivot template, still use PhoneTextNormal style for the title).
__label__0 The current design of the CameraCaptureUI on Windows 10 desktop/tablet renders it useless.

__label__0 Besides it will have a broader reach to consumers.
__label__1 Provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only.
__label__0 why not supporting dominated Windows 7?
__label__0 I'm currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities (most notably [.exe and ].exe).
__label__1 It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than 100KB (1 MB at least) this would prevent us from having to depend on a network/paid service to have great cross-device customer experiences.
__label__0 dictionaries).
__label__0 In my view, the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows: 1.

As a Windows app consumer, I want to be able to search for apps by name, so that I can find and download the specific app I am looking for.
__label__0 I have a Windows 10 notebook with a second screen.
__label__0 When it will be fixed?
__label__0 List will appear and we select from list n call.
__label__0 NameResolutionFailure, SendFailure: check your internet connection TrustFailure: please add our certificate Timeout: woops, our servers are down, please try again later ProtocolError: something went wrong, please try again later
__label__0 Is that right?
__label__0 Web sites like Tweetdeck, Pandora, Facebook, Bing, etc. all include this functionality.
__label__0 At Build 2018 support between Cortana and Alexa was announced.
__label__0 Would be nice to have.
__label__0 But after this new version and generation into WP and W8.1, I manage once with success installation but NOW can't be installed and always asked for install from STORE.
__label__0 However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:
__label__0 This means the task can not execute for the full 15 minute window.
__label__1 Create a Cordova plugin to enable IOS and Android hybrid apps to use Project Rome features.
__label__1 I would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature.
__label__0 I uninstalled all plugins and I only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure
__label__1 It would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the BIOS menu.
__label__0 This allows a team to use these devices for testing, as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations.
__label__0 On this page there is explanation how to make a file explorer integration on a desktop bridge app:
__label__1 This should display as the characters themselves, rather than just as the code.
__label__0 Also, the tab does not stay unpinned.
__label__0 It would allow us to skip all that crazy input in 32 different languages, just to (for example) swap out one screenshot.
__label__0 facing problem while I open my app.
__label__1 To solve that it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps.
__label__0 Seems deceptive to say that the device has NFC capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag.
__label__0 Should I just assume that spamming multiple apps is ok and do the same in order to compete?
__label__0 As a starting point, it would be fine for the developer to download from the Dev Center a 'starter template' that is a ZIP file with basic XML templates and placeholder filenames, which the developer could then tweak/modify for the app she wants to submit.
__label__1 My desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if I've listened to a podcast completely from either source (i.e. from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone) that the episode would be marked listened to (or read) and disappear from the list in Feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my BeyondPod list.
__label__0 After clicking on the only link on the page I get an empty page.
__label__1 If I have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user's contacts, I should have a way to click on that user and show the user's details in the native experience.
__label__0 I'm delaying the registration and app creation, untill it is possible.
__label__0 Unacceptable.
__label__0 BB has this as a standard feature out of the box, while 3rd party apps are available under IOS (though not half as good as the BB).
__label__0 I am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V.
__label__0 In short, if low bandwidth MMOs could be made which scaled in revenue and bandwidth according to how many of the apps are purchased/in use.
__label__0 but it lacks the capability to increase volume of the device or costomize live tiles or backround.
__label__0 It is equal if i use my iPad or my iphone (different provider sim cards) , both are showing me the error that no connection is there.
__label__0 - PDB loading and parsing is still slow, and that's after the fix that took you many months to solve (https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1017787/msdia120-dll-handles-zo-pdb-files-extremely-slowly).
__label__1 Provide a workaround for removing the ru language from the language history (I have no need for ru culture just for ru-ru, but there is no way to remove ru from the language history if you ever posted your app with ru language support) 2.
__label__0 I'm using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions.
__label__0 Many times apps/games were made free for limited time as offers promotions .
__label__0 But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.
__label__0 Pros of 3d graphics support: 1.
__label__0 The lack of Reflection.Emit in UWP significantly impacts the ability of developers to create clean, AAA-compliant unit tests in an MVVM environment (the recommended architecture for building UWP apps).

__label__0 A better implementation might expose a new property or method on MediaLibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object.
__label__0 We can see page transition effect on settings page.
__label__1 just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a 2.5kg laptop wherever he goes...
__label__0 Why can't Microsoft shut down all the extraneous accounts?
__label__0 The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.

__label__0 2
__label__0 Street names color stays black and not being centered.
__label__0 This is for perform any action on background!
__label__0 15 from Germany (all with 4 stars), 1 from USA (1 star) and 4 from France (5 stars) If you now open the app in the Windows Phone Store from Germany, you will see a total app review rating of 15 (4 stars).
__label__0 How many consumers runs W10 on their PCs or laptops?
__label__0 In a properly formatted RSS article, the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online.
__label__0 Then, it would be up to the app developer to allow that functionality.
__label__0 I have two identical USB Zebra printers and cannot tell them apart.
__label__1 It would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the DOM that is in the currently loaded page of the WebView control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary.

__label__0 We have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app.
__label__1 The donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations, similar to unclaimed flatters.
__label__0 Could you fix it?
__label__0 When accidentally hitting X button while typing email, offer cancel in addition to save and delete
__label__0 When the application is unpublished by Microsoft, the reason in sent by email.
__label__0 They may have been in a country that is not supported for example.
__label__0 What's going on here ?
__label__0 MS Edge is not bad however people have different requirements for web browsers.
__label__0 As a developer I create submissions for my apps.
__label__1 Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app, or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.
__label__0 This feature was planned for WP7 but was removed for RTM**.

__label__1 To solve that it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps.
__label__1 Allow the ability to Open the Explorer and show a selected file in the Explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible.
__label__0 Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions.
__label__1 allow all those folders which are accessible by a filepicker to be accesed directly by code or by using path to a specific file in computer's hard drive.

or you can say that once a user had selected some files with filepicker these files should be able to be used in future run of app without need of filepicker, and 1000 should not be a limit, user can just allow the app to access specific folders of the computer, so we will not need a futureaccesslist api .
__label__0 Because this is SSO for phone, the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly.
__label__0 Also service is too slow.
__label__0 All subsequent children's book apps will be essentially undiscoverable no matter how good they are... Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as childrens stories so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps.
__label__0 I'm using the result of MidiOutPort::GetDeviceSelector() for the device selector string.
__label__0 This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items.
__label__0 I see that you are currently developing within one region and now want to develop within Turkey.
__label__0 In code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer Windows 10 builds (using ApiInformation) so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds.
__label__0 Buffer overrun while writing to 'm_pDACL': the writable size is 'pDACL->AclSize' bytes but '8' bytes might be written.
__label__0 This affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform.
__label__1 Microsoft could recoup its costs by an extra overhead on sales of such applications.
__label__1 Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley.
__label__0 In this way, the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent.
__label__0 Adding new test users without new submission.
__label__1 Please modify like this. 
__label__0 I like to keep my start screen tidy with relatively few apps, but the alphabetized list is cumbersome when I forget the name of an app.
__label__0 I've updated my ipad and now can't use feedly with buffer at all.
__label__0 I see blank page.

__label__1 Please allow API access for 3rd party developers to set ringer volume/mute/vibrate.
__label__0 Please consider adding this type of feature to feedly.
__label__1 There should be a better way to compile those node.js modules that depend on C/C++ for example socket.io
__label__0 Without that, we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.
__label__0 For instance, texts, contacts (read/write), sockets in listening, real multitasking, etc... We know that you released a super-restricted API to avoid developing apps that could give inexpert users troubles.
__label__1 I want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life.
__label__1 Would be great to be able to read my feedly feeds on ighome.com instead of having to go to feedly.com.

__label__0 It does not show up with financial p;lanner either.
__label__0 I think the new dev center is a great step.
__label__1 For me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting/updating my app rather than having to provide a URL so I think this should be an option.
__label__0 keyword filtering, deleting articles/authors not of interest, prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT.
__label__0 But text-only imports, with just a link, as I come up with with gmail app is poor.
__label__0 Using MouseLeftButtonUp will randomly activate when dragging and lifting your finger, which is an unwanted result for a menu.
__label__1 Please add AllAccountsReadWrite to UserDataAccountStoreAccessType in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers
__label__0 We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.
__label__0 In the current version anyone can read or remove notifications when screen is locked, without knowing the password.
__label__0 Is there any plan to fix it for next OS Update ?
__label__0 According to the documentation it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.
__label__0 UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third-class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP!
__label__0 The only work around I found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in the… more
__label__0 Developers is your partner and allow to use bank transfer for registration.
__label__0 The Alarm and Reminder classes in Microsoft.Phone.Scheduler are very limiting and do not allow for any customization.
__label__0 For now we have no option but to re-build the app to a non-Microsoft environment.
__label__0 Note 3 , lg g2 xperia z1 all have snapdragon 800 and support 4k video recording , why not Lumia phones..
__label__0 I don't like comparisons, however all the Windows 10 UWP effort is another attempt to get users into the Windows platform right?

Well, you're still missing the point .
__label__0 A general use case is that I'm working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now I stopped debugging and now I started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the device get locked and again if I debug the app then the same error popups.
__label__1 Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling, just like the Windows Store.
__label__0 Speech API is an essential part for a lot of people on the desktop.
__label__0 this is most like
__label__0 The Quickstart video on MVA is excellent but, where is the code?
__label__0 A event that triggers after a call has ended with: Phone nr and Call Length, also giving an opportunity to display an app screen.
__label__0 visitors can see www.domain.com ?
__label__1 Better marketplace - I would like a new UI 9.
__label__0 Numeric only passwords makes more sense for Smartphone world as its fast, convenient and easy to type.
__label__0 But the problem is the App name automatically reserved to the Tab version, and the package name also.
__label__1 Compile the app and the Xaml compiler throws the exception.
__label__1 This needs to be fixed.
__label__0 You know it for sure: one developer produces great software like Google Chrome Paint.net or many others.
__label__0 As a result all of the notification strings have to be generated server-side iterating for all the languages supported by the client (like https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/notification-hubs-ios-xplat-localized-apns-push-notification/) .
__label__1 The first feature I wanted to suggest is that I believe Cortana is lacking certain capabilities on Apple iOS; specifically the ability for Cortana to send emails from the Cortana App directly by Outlook for iPhone.
__label__0 Copy any number of the internet / documents and try and put it into calculator app.
__label__0 Seems that the body is included in the image attached.
__label__0 Currently In MasterView we can only use ListView.
__label__0 I understand this framework is still being developed and real-word usage must first be measured.
__label__0 Debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine
__label__0 Sort of annoying to have to press attach three times to send three different pics.
__label__0 TextBox, it's a big problem.
__label__0 Currently cloud.feedly.com works only with IE10 browser which is still rather new to the world (especially corporate one).
__label__0 My approach is 100% XAML and doesn't require messy calculations.
__label__1 When viewing feeds from dribbble.com, I would like to have a 'Like' button that is integrated with the 'Like' mechanisms from their site
__label__1 It would be great if there was a Feedly plug-in for the Mozilla Thunderbird email client.
__label__0 Now my killer app has to wait for windows to catch up again.
__label__0 1
__label__0 However there's an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching.
__label__0 sending an UDP Broadcast (send to 255.255.255.255) is not supported.
__label__0 In [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&prof=required) following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted.
__label__1 Add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios.
__label__1 Following the comments on the blog post for AF_UNIX it would be nice to see SOCK_SEQPACKET and/or SOCK_DGRAM support.
__label__1 bring RIP Silverlight deepzoom control to UWP control and pivotviewer too with win2D capabilities
__label__0 Other dev sites let you select these options during the submission process.
__label__0 The Silverlight textbox doesn't support this kind of scrolling, and forces the user to long tap on it until the caret appears, then move his finger to the sides of the textbox.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to load XAML from string without freezing UI - it could easily take over 200ms to load a short bit of XAML.
__label__0 When I'm done using a Customer Group I cannot delete or hide it.
__label__0 I would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx.
__label__1 So please remove this restriction.
__label__0 I think having 3 variations (did I forget any?)
__label__0 This will allow bulk importing of saved for later items into tools like pinboard.in
__label__0 There are few standard patterns for navigation and if Split view has those OOB then developing apps because a breeze.
__label__0 Hello I am new to the forum so I apologize if this is not in the incorrect area to post this.
__label__0 The same applies when you list all apps from the publisher/developer.
__label__0 Hugs from Brazil.
__label__0 When you view an exception you get a completely useless stacktrace with only hex values for function names because of optimization.
__label__1 It would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in ScrollViewer with an API or with any other option to disable it.
__label__0 The current design of the CameraCaptureUI on Windows 10 desktop/tablet renders it useless.
__label__1 Please provide a property to enable/disable this feature.
__label__0 thank you Jose Lopes
__label__0 The keyboard usually lags and decides to disappear while im writing so i spend more time trying to display it back than typing.
__label__0 - User Configurable - Dynamic configurable for App/Game Developers [Say, F1= Fire, F2=Reload, F7=Secondary Weapon, F3=Cycle Weapons] - F4 = Touch Scroll + Fingerprint Reader It can look ugly... but will be a lot useful for customizing the device in a larg
__label__0 After the video the user has to press back twice to get to my app.
__label__0 Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....
__label__0 To get the keyboard to return you have to tap it again and this happens on every single box.
__label__0 I'm a web developer and I just wanted to copy the URL of the feed.
__label__0 You're alienating your developers with this stuff and to be honest, it's just unacceptable.
__label__1 Allow an API to cause the window to be always on top.

__label__0 So I can launch Feedly from google desktop app launcher.
__label__1 Please provide with more information or planschedule.
__label__0 1000 entries as limit for FutureAccessList is way to low.
__label__1 What would be nice is instead of sending tile notifications for every minute if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute.
__label__0 In practice there is no way to petiton for help.
__label__0 The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe 15 times in a row and then simply stop working and never return... despite having a timeout parameter!??
__label__0 Allow Windows IoT Enterprise embedded devices to run a WUP app and access its own PCIe Hardware.
__label__0 I selected a set of 3rd party drivers and my PC immediately failed to boot.
__label__0 I'm guessing it's a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack.
__label__0 For example if you want a feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags  #retail #design ; http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/retail+design; would be a feedly feed.
__label__0 I have not found an easy way to download payout summary in an automated fashion.
__label__0 I have performed a save multiple times, as its not always instant (a limitation of integrating with a third party I understand).
__label__1 i want to add clock controller visually to show time
__label__0 For instance, if I build a children's book app and then submit that same app 50 times, each time with a different name and book loaded, i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen, thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design.
__label__0 There are several developers using dishonest methods to boost their apps, including fake ratings.

Those apps are as good as useless to consumers (cheap website wrappers etc.) and still have dozens of maximum ratings shortly after being released.

Those apps get ranked high in the listings and take away the place of the few others that actually are good.

Reporting usually takes several days or more than one week until something actually happens.

Also, I've heard that MS just warns those devs, but even lets them keep obvious fake max ratings.
__label__0  ** Currently the Pivot has no overflow-panel.
__label__0 Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test… more
__label__1 Would love the ability to monitor specific pages that don't have rss feeds at set intervals, and be able to vary the alert options, such as getting an email etc when the pages change.
__label__0 Now I have a painful regime of monkey motion to go through to test them one by one (even with binary search it's going to be painful).
__label__1 Add the ability to see lyrics of music files in the music application for running music
__label__0 This is contrary to the docs and to expected behavior.
__label__0 If you have a password set on your lockscreen, swipe up to show the password keyboard.

__label__0 In WP8, the default Pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the PhoneFontFamilySemiBold and PhoneFontSizeMedium styles, but the standard blank page template still uses PhoneTextNormalStyle (which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size) for the page title.
__label__0 It's mini mode has exactly the same limitation.
__label__0 Nevertheless there's one thing that annoys me
__label__0 One public folder with full access as flash memory with configurable size.
__label__0 SAP is superior to only HF as it enables e.g.
__label__0 I'm working on a feedly application and I want to add some pro features like in-stream search, but I'm not able to test these because i don't have a pro account.
__label__0 The MediaPlayer class can play Song objects, but there is currently no way to get at the song data.
__label__0 How to you intend your Surface Pro users to keep the Surface steady with one hand while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand?
__label__0 It's a minor thing, but for someone who follows a lot of tumblr blogs, it can get annoying.
__label__0 However, if you manually Google what the standard format for feeds is with Wordpress and try out ?
__label__0 I don't know if you have to have two sets of speakers or two microphones or a way to separate left speaker from right but It would make a whole lot of devs happy to be able to do this
__label__0 to science for kids only.
__label__1 Spam applications should not be approved.
__label__0 Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days___ more
__label__0 In addition, app names are quite specific and so searches for 'Facebook' and 'Wordament' should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as 'crosswords'.
__label__1 Provide an api to list all the installed applications in a wp8 device.This functionality can be enable once the user enroll successfully through company app
__label__0 You can reproduce it adding rectangles with 100px, 200px and 300px of height and calling ScrollIntoView to the last item.

__label__0 100% reproducible on Lumia 920 cyan update.
__label__0 I often post to both from Feedly, but this requires a lot of logging in and out.
__label__0 If i want to subscribe to tumblr blog, assume /rss at the end of a link I paste, I now have to manually add /rss to links like http://spaceyspacelifeisneat.tumblr.com/ to subscribe
__label__0 This is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing you're slowing the UI and negatively affecting the user experience.
__label__0 Why was it necessary for us all to have.
__label__0 Manage my total apps purchase by deleting the unwanted apps from the total list similar like google store... And also give the ability to filter my payment purchased apps
__label__0 One simple example where the WrapPanel is essential is when displaying a_____ more
__label__0 I didn't put the tab there, and I DON'T WANT IT.
__label__0 ApplicationView.SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead.
__label__0 I just cant use the chrome extrension.	
__label__0 I prefer to use Chrome and it crashes constantly in Feedly on my iPAD if I browse beyond the article 's page.
__label__0 The following example doesn't show an error in the Designer but throws errors in the generated code.
__label__0 the button to subscribe to rss with feedly in Firefox actually does nothing
__label__0 Especially for StringFormatConverter and FormatStingConverter.
__label__0 This .NET property helps to determine what was wrong during the request.
__label__0 Currently Microsoft Store under Windows 10 shows three types of information:

__label__1 Please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least 100 or 255 characters long.
__label__1 We need to be able to test our applications with other windows apps installed.
__label__0 I don't know if wordpress has an API for this; 
__label__0 IE in WP8.1 (with all updates) gives error/doesn't load page if the body tag contains onLoad window.location function (i.e.
__label__1 In fact we can use 0xE7D Share with FontIcon element without the enumeration.
__label__0 Others are having the same problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4170587/how-to-launch-a-youtube-url-on-windows-phone-7 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4272293/youtube-on-windows-phone-with-mediaelement
__label__0 These capabilities are well supported by other platforms and I would like to see this support on WP8 too.
__label__0 __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________API____________________________________ __________________________________________________________________NG________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__label__1 For a classic desktop application we need a TabControl.
__label__1 It would be useful to have either backgroundNetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundMediaPlayback capability and if playback is active (which can possibly be using network communication) and app is not suspended keep network communication active.
__label__1 But why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators?
__label__0 The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters, add audio tracks, crop out a relevant section, etc... of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary.
__label__0 I apologise if there are better or more appropriate places to post this idea.
__label__0 However, there is no category for publishing apps in such a category and most of the users react unintelligibly and give bad reviews as they expect a fully grown product.
__label__1  Allow a new version of NewsRob to use the feedly backend API.
__label__0 I'm limited to IE 7 on Windows XP at work.
__label__0 if the Microsoft force users to use Office or force developers to use SkyDrive by this way, may take the opposite result, and lost users and developers..
__label__0 Should I just assume that spamming multiple apps is ok and do the same in order to compete?
__label__0 The store is unusable.
__label__0 For example one thing I can't do right now is a simple search popup that would let me keep focus in where I'm searching similar to how search in Cortana works.
__label__1 add a filter, crop, etc), and then the opened app can pass that edited file back to my app.
__label__0 Issues resulted of mixing technologies that work in different ways, documentation is also 3rd party and may be poor, needs to learn separately, may be removed in the future, different from official documentation, not good at mixing with existing functions of the high_____ more
__label__0 That would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app.
__label__0 Windows launch at random places on the desktop.
__label__0 Not being able to compile shaders at runtime is a huge inconvenience, and prevents projects like ANGLE from producing a fully compliant OpenGL port.
__label__0 At Build 2018 support between Cortana and Alexa was announced.
__label__0 All my tests and researches made be waste two days for nothing.
__label__0 Wait for 15-20 minutes and switch on the mobile again.
__label__1 If using tap/hold, allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above.
__label__0 Very usefull to adjust own searches
__label__0 Invariably, some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the 1-way nature of the Reviews.
__label__0 As a developer I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
__label__0 It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection( as is in the normal Windows 10 Windows Hello Settings page).

__label__1 Scan it and Bing Vision give u a list of the nearest theatres and show times, or post a reminder in your calendar.
__label__0 I decoded it using http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx When I encode M1STURM/ANDREAS EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C>5080 B2A N00  using http://www.java4less.com/barcodes/AztecCode/php/demo.php I can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode correctly.
__label__0 The current options have the current drawbacks for me:
__label__0 As usual Microsoft is late in this too, and so we have to focus development on iOS and android that have the SDK up to date with technology.
__label__1 My suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on Lock/Unlock transitions.
__label__0 Seems my users would prefer watching a video always-on-top with a larger size.
__label__1 Please support multi-segment path for this method or at least return a message giving more details.
__label__0 BlackBerry has an Android runtime that can be used to run Android .apk files and developers can port their Android app to the BB OS.
__label__0 Also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content.
__label__0 It looks like the bridge cannot remove its own folder while cleaning up the environment.
__label__1 What I really want are GMail-style filters for feeds, to automatically star or mark as read based on matches.
__label__0 If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
__label__0 I am shocked why it is not built-in, it lows down the value of high level WinRT by very much to me.
__label__0 I'm betting on WP7 growing in 2012 - U need to do a MUCH better 'Job' on the TV advertising - I saw the start of the TV advert and said to myself 'Please don't let this be the new WP7 ad ' and sure as heck it was.
__label__0 Play among yourselves.
__label__0 Waiting for reply.
__label__0 Dear Team Support, I was uploading games in windows phone store, but from last Friday there seems to be some kind of bug in your windows phone store.
__label__0 However, Podacasts do not pause and will continue to play (inaudibly) in the background as you interact with Cortanta.
__label__0 It looks that it removes something from the folder but it cannot.

__label__0 the ContentTemplateSelector is broken when binding to ViewModels.

__label__0 It takes years to learn how to handle windows 7.
__label__0 The above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element but clamp it within a specific range.
__label__0 Today only SelectRange(ItemIndexRange itemIndexRange) exists in ListView to add new selection range to the current selection and SelectedRanges property is only { get; }.
__label__0 With apps increasingly going the encrypted route our app (EarTrumpet) is finding it harder and harder to retrieve the running appx app's current application icon (i.e.
__label__0 This property is missing in UWP.
__label__0 We use Feedly and the Buffer link in a work environment.	
__label__0 suppress the tie beetwin the keyboards of my two computers, so I have not to change it at any time I start

__label__0 I like it because of its built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts, which the Google Reader app didn't have.
__label__0 Touchdevelop is a good start.
__label__1 at least allow configuring the action for long press.
__label__0 Much nicer in dark environment when dark theme I chosen.
__label__0 I would imagine that there____d be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers (hover/touch, etc), change properties (color, opacity, etc).

__label__0 WM6.1 & WM6.2 has that feature but since WM6.5, the feature has just disappeared...
__label__0 will significal improve advanced users experience.
__label__0 I might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment.
__label__1 Having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea.
__label__0 This would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device.
__label__0 While using C++ could provide the necessary access and performance, many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine-grained that dropping to C++ from C# repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower.
__label__0 But there's no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded.
__label__0 Other platforms(android) can play them(touchshow) how does a windows phone not?
__label__0 Word displays documents terribly.
__label__1 Hence some reasonable feature should be implemented on App Studio/OneDrive to make this possible.
__label__0 The Windows RT simulator lets you emulate multitouch interaction by exploiting the use of the mouse wheel.
__label__0 That's really bad though, we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it!
__label__0 will waste in performance.
__label__0 In both cases what should be a float:left is actually changed in the code to a float:right.
__label__0 I wish to support many platforms as best I can with as much common code as possible.
__label__0 I Also wrote on MSDN Forum, but I received no reply...
__label__0 And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.
__label__1 I WANT see ELECTRONICS CENTER APP on market_____ more
__label__0 In the Dashboard, the submission is configured like this: Distribution = Your app can be found by customers browsing or searching the Store.
__label__0 HLS becomes more and more popular to stream live video contents on mobile devices.
__label__0 Some of the above is already possible today (there's some Virtual-Audio-Cable solutions) but it's cumbersome non-standard and definetely not done (optimized?)
__label__0 Not having these APIs means I cannot as a developer make an app that uses the Surface touch screen to control music software.
__label__0 I'm missing the ability to change the font name/size and color.
__label__1 It would be great to have some integration with that app.
__label__0 Just YouTube using Google Wallet at McD.
__label__0 However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the I cursor makes contact with some text.
__label__0 That means the change was never written back to the original item.
__label__1 I would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in 1080x1920 pixel size.
__label__0 Obviously this is in place to ensure people do not spend lots of money if they don't have unlimited bundles.
__label__0 I have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks, and when I tried to implement scheduling I was surprised to see that this is not available on Windows.
__label__1 I would like to control have my app control the vibration/haptic feedback setting.
__label__0 With Swype, you can type much faster.
__label__0 I'm German and my English is not so good.
__label__0 I had posted this on the VS uservoice site https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/7542181-add-f-support-for-net-native but it looks like that was the wrong place to do that.
__label__0 No signin/ signup using Microsoft account on this very website seriously?

I signed up using my Facebook account.

The other option is Google account.

While being open is great, have you forgotten something here?
__label__0 (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj207065(v=vs.105).aspx) This means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the SD card.
__label__1 It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels
__label__0 When you select either on it automtically adds the font to a Folder under your project called Fonts that you can specify using a ms-appx resource path...
__label__0 What do you people think, do you hear where I am coming from with this idea?
__label__1 I really want this features because its useful in many ways.
__label__0 I have a Samsung Focus S which has the camera button on the side.
__label__0 Use case: As neither Groove nor Spotify have a lyrics functionality (anymore) I created a simple UWP app to manage lyrics for songs.
__label__1 Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device 
__label__1 I'd like to see a way for any UWP app to opt-in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot.
__label__1 This would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead / power usage longer battery life.
__label__0 We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available.
__label__0 i have an computer with window 8 pro...32bit.... and an windows 8 phone but u are not providing an app that links both i.e i want sdk-8 compatible with 32bit operating system the sdk-8 software u provide only works in 64bit systems
__label__0 Hello Feedly developers, here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators.	
__label__0 I filed one against a Microsoft example on Github here:
__label__1 We need to be able to use third party Bluetooth equipment!
__label__0 Windows is the only platform that doesn't support this natively.
__label__0 That is good for multitasking and it resumes the work from where we left but still if I have done using it, I can't close it down.
__label__0 Programmatically enable or disable the feature___ more
__label__0 We use MediaComposition to generate thumbnails for mp4 video files.
__label__0 So I think you should_____ more
__label__0 Users are sensitive to data usage because it costs them money.
__label__0 If Windows Phones are to compete they have to acknowledge the big selling apps, or they risk losing market share rather than gaining it.
__label__0 Add the support in the Visual Studio designer to preview another language than the app default language
__label__0 Seeing as SplitView is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area, it would make sense for SplitView to allow a PanePlacement.Top and PanePlacement.Bottom in addition to its current Left and Right parameters.

This change would allow Developer to be able to consider the usage of SplitView when targetting small WVGA/WXGA such as the Lumia 520/525/530 which have an extremely thin horizontal resolution compared to its available vertical space.

If this change was made, it would be easier to target a UI to low resolution/low end devices by being able to set the pane to top or bottom for the apps menu controls instead of having to rig together a solution of setting the visibility of an external control and turning off a bunch of settings on the pane when screen resolution gets narrow enough.
__label__0 When the app gets built, it generates a single package that can be distributed to any version of the OS (within developer-set version limitations).
__label__1 Please add Evernote support to the iPhone for Pro users
__label__0 Something like Requesting Reviews on iOS 10.3 SKStoreReviewController
__label__1 Please release ShellTile.TileData() function in next build.
__label__0 As it is now when i export, with the evernote-button, an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again.
__label__1 Make it so the Xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder 5.
__label__0 We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.
__label__0 The Photo app on Windows 8 is not nearly good enough.
__label__0 The inner exception that has sense is the System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException.
__label__1 If you do not yet, I highly recommend to open show print version.
__label__0 I find that it's really well hidden sometimes I can't find it at all.
__label__1 Build support for bullets and numbering into the Paragraph class with properties something like this NumberStart int, -1 = inherit from previous run NumberStyle enum {None, Bullet, Arabic, Letter, Roman} NumberFlags enum flags {UpperCase, DottedLevels} NumberLevel int Make NumberStyle default to None and all this is non-breaking.
__label__1 The Evernote Web Clipper allows to me save the full page, but I would love to be able to do this straight from Feedly.
__label__1 Typical problem here would be deployment(Installationupdate) of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file It should not depend on reference libraries.
__label__0 Which seems like something that Feedly might have been able to guess to begin with.
__label__0 Best plays.
__label__0 Some users certainly will find this useful.
__label__0 Those were not restored either.
__label__0 Just to be clear, this is *not* a duplicate of http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3743880-please-provide-etw-logging-from-a-windows-phone-8 - as a reply in that thread points out, you can already log ETW events from a WP8 app.
__label__0 I Have problems with Contact class on Windows 8.1 and WindowsPhone 8.1 With this code: var p = new Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactPicker(); p.DesiredFieldsWithContactFieldType.Add(Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactFieldType.Email); IList<Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact> contacts = await p.PickContactsAsync(); if (contacts.Count > 0) { foreach (Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact c in contacts) { await new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(c.FirstName +  -  + c.LastName + \n + c.Id).ShowAsync(); } } In Windows 8.1 the field LastName is always empty and the field FirstName also contains LastName.
__label__0 _ As you can see, it fails at the position where the > should be.
__label__0 When sending the message the receiving port is choosen randomly by the windows phone.
__label__0 See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239)
__label__0 If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).
__label__0 Photos, email, internet, games, and stability in their learning curve.
__label__0 This option is also not work until we have metadata of song i.e.
__label__0 Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.
__label__0 There are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work.
__label__1 The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI and Services ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.
__label__0 I can hear people hardly when calling mobile or landline but when calling international numbers it's just not possible to hear what people says.
__label__0 When you registered with wrong account you need to contact Microsoft support and cancel it and needs to signup with correct Microsoft account again.
__label__0 This is confusing for users as they are seeing the same items multiple times.
__label__1 Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool.
__label__0 (Like Photo app)
__label__0 Other little bugs: with my lumia 820 before first WP8 upgrade work fine with vocal commands but from___ more
__label__0 This looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my RSS.
__label__0 The Enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level - either in-house or to clients.
__label__0 I hope I can pause or play music on live tiles___
__label__0 It simply doesn't work.
__label__1 Please bring all languages to Cortana for IoT because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world.
__label__0 all this is because of a simple reason 'Security' which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there.
__label__0 The SerialDevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as Native.
__label__0 I love one note because of its fast cross platform sync, i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes, adding a button in the dialer (Loudspeaker, mute, hold, add call.. ) to open OneNote will help me open it easily.
__label__1 So please provide this extra info in the Contact data returned with a search.
__label__0 This is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a Service Discovery browser.
__label__0 That's a huge problem regarding developer investing on the platform.
__label__1 The Music+Videos app should have side selection boxes in every category like the ones used for selecting multiple messages in the e-mail app, making it easier to create playlists, and play selected songs/artists/albums/genres/videos.
__label__0 clicking hyperlinks, mailto: links, or dial phone numbers).
__label__1 While this could be also a fix for Roslyn System.Runtime.CSharp.Analyzers the generated Bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings.
__label__0 We can set the preferred browser on iOS, this rocks.
__label__0 We are working on the Converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the Windows Store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of Windows as well and so we can't afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being.
__label__0 WP8 SDK provides file type association http://utorrentideas.uservoice.com/forums/47263-%C2%B5torrent-for-windows/suggestions/3417415-torrent-file-association-in-windows-phone, please provide the same feature in WP7.8

__label__0 Unfortunately the ScheduledToastNotification which is just a ToastNotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature.
__label__1 I strongly think that more background color's should be there, like instead of just black and white, have blue, red, green and stuff___ more
__label__0 At the first time, I didn't know to to fix the error so I had to factory reset my PC.
__label__1 Companies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this, but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform.
__label__0 As a feedback, a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read and/or donated a certain article is shown.
__label__0 When a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video.
__label__1 Include an API to add, remove, deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL), to further drive down data usage, enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking, and just having a sense of control.
__label__0 Then devs can use Connected Animations.
__label__0 More info about the problem can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11539755/winrt-frame-and-page-caching-how-to-create-new-page-instance-on-navigate-and http://caliburnmicro.com/announcements/application-state-part-1/ http://caliburnmicro.com/announcements/application-state-part-2/ http://caliburnmicro.com/announcements/application-state-part-3/ https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/95
__label__0 But then what is the point of the SD card, if the developer is restricted to the phone's internal memory...
__label__0 There are more and more external sensors, not only medical, but all kind of proximity stuff for watches, smart apliances, cars, and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps.
__label__1 I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool(option in emulator) with which we can take screenshots once, in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app.
__label__0 However there is still a 5mm gap at the top of the page (not including the space for the time etc) that is wasteful.
__label__0 Even went so far as to chat and the rep indicate that this not currently supported.
__label__0 Some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app.
__label__0 In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes visual programming animation software single/multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others.
__label__0 There is no serious TFS application on Windows Phone Store.
__label__0 It worked fairly well on WP8.1 but now on W10M when you go to the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile.
__label__0 This would allow (as others have suggested) a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks.
__label__0 So I've developed a work around to detect key pushes for LeftCtrl and RightAlt and if both are pressed at the same time then LeftCtrl pushes are ignored.
__label__0 Thanks!!!

__label__0 I'm a school teacher.

__label__0 My Customer (I'm an Office 365 Consultant) are struggling with the adoption of this new way of working because of simple things like this that annoy and takes 2-10 minutes per person per working spot.
__label__0 The more complex an API feature the less likely there'll be useful documentation on how to use it or how it behaves.
__label__0 After a trial has expired the expiration date is set to:
__label__0 this gives them impression that my APP is slow.
__label__1 Please remove the cert process for these and allow them to be added *instantly*
__label__1 Could you please increase the maximum size or better: remove it at all!
__label__0 Being able to target multiple versions of Windows with a single project, one that, preferably, built a single app package, would be useful.
__label__0 For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision.
__label__0 If this is a bug in wp8.1 then please fix it.
__label__0 I'm using the Microsoft example found here:

__label__0 As a recent purchaser of a Windows Phone: I love the platform, and it has huge potential to grow in competition with Android and Apple.
__label__0 Other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full.

__label__0 I have posted my 1st application on windows store, with 9 keywords.

__label__0 Your account is validating by Symantec.

You cannot submit any app during this period.

It will takes 7 to 10 days typically.

Open your account settings and make sure registered information is correct.

When you modify account information, vetting will be triggered automatically.
__label__0 On the Apple store for a long time it was in the top 50 financial apps.
__label__1 It should return DOM element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes.
__label__0 http://yves.vg/testcases/ie_mobi/keyup_event.html
__label__0 It also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches.
__label__0 I think of marketplace, voice navigation, maps (possibility to search for closest restaurant etc.
__label__1 Please allow some way for RSS services to get access to that data, especially since Feedly is so big.
__label__0 windows app development freedom
__label__0 This gives you low latency input in case of a busy UI thread.
__label__0 We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block
__label__0 This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar ItemClicked event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.
__label__0 There are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower [e.g.
__label__0 A virtual android application that allows the end-user to play and install android apps on a windows phone within the app.
__label__0 There is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard.
__label__0 Many users still complains about given volume even fade in doesn't save the situation.
__label__0 I have found no way to get the Information, that the user has set his format settings to irish.
__label__1 Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines.
__label__0 None of my customers understand why they cant just connect the phone to thier PCs and the files are automatically sync'ed to a folder dedicated for this.
__label__1 I'd love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a 2D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel.
__label__0 Remote xaml isn____t likely allowed, and even if it were, there____d be resistance to providing vector art in two formats when SVG_____ more
__label__0 x.x IP address of the emulator - but I can find no way to get that programmatically either.
__label__0 I find that it's really well hidden sometimes I can't find it at all.
__label__0 Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently.
__label__0 I'm not happy to implement something which is already there.
__label__1 I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found.
__label__0 I don't know what that means.
__label__1 Why can we not just have a store manifest that includes all localized descriptions, screenshots, etc.
__label__0 Allows C++ developers to produce components with a well-known ABI avoid the messing to recompile tons of sources every time
__label__0 Additionally, the app itself is responsible for what it exposes; and it would not be able to chain access to any other area - only data in its isolated storage space for functions that are allowed as tasks.
__label__0 This is not a breaking change.
__label__1 I would like to be able to enable WP alerts be forwarded to XBox One when I am near it or manually configured for it.
__label__0 From http://moderncpp.com/ Modern is a Standard C++ language projection for the Windows Runtime.

__label__0 As such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming HTTP request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics.
__label__0 I cannot tell if this is a problem with Edge or with Feedly.
__label__0 But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.
__label__0 Maybe the normal screen timeout would apply here as well, rather than the lock screen timeout.
__label__0 Step to reproduce: 1.)
__label__0 One usage scenario of IAPs is to offer new features to users and in the IAP description it must_____ more
__label__0 Of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification.
__label__0 Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window's startup position (left top width/right height/bottom) beyond full-screen and/or maximized.
__label__1 It would be great if the <Application Executable=launcher.exe> element or the <uap3:Extension Category=windows.appExecutionAlias> element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest.xml file.
__label__1 I belive it's critical to make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined UI.
__label__1 Would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs.
__label__0 The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval, phones seem to ignore it completely e.g.
__label__0 : the stuff published by Eric_rulz)...
__label__1 Can you please provide a report viewer control to view SSRS reports in windows phone.
__label__0 For that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay, because it makes my reading faster.
__label__0 The <li><table> tags are displayed very small in size.
__label__0 It also cause a lot of problem either from QA or the user because of invalid data that was entered.
__label__1 Especially if we also can have a delete appointment-chooser (user will need to confirm deletion).
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time___ more
__label__0 WinRT information: The maximum number (1000) of items in the access list has been reached.
__label__0 When we long-press on a link in Feedly or in a web view, we're given the option to add it to Reading List, but not to Instapaper or any of the other Read Later services.	
__label__1 Make the Safari extension open the Feedly page in a new tab/window when clicking the Feedly button, similar to the Safari GReader extension.
__label__1 Allow users to either upload videos or embed youtube videos in their application listing so that clients can see gameplay and/or trailer videos, which increases the possibilities of sales.
__label__0 Big lack.
__label__0 It is a useful feature.
__label__0 This is a problem!
__label__0 Otherwise yet again MVVM is broken.
__label__0 Right now, if I have two Google accounts (and separate Chrome sessions) - one for work and one for personal use, I cant use feedly across sessions
__label__1 You need to provide CoreWindow.Minimise() api in this case.
__label__0 The Backgroundtasks can currently be launched every 15 minutes by the TimeTrigger.
__label__0 5) Connect to port and try to send data to it
__label__0 I thought the ability to create albums in 'photos' would really help users be more organized in storing their photos.
__label__1 and now that i am in my 50's Iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate.
__label__0 Is there any plan to fix it for next OS Update ?
__label__1 If I dont like someone elses idea allow my 1-3 votes to takes votes OFF their vote count on a 1:1 vote basis.
__label__0 Would be most appreciated!
__label__0 It was 30 bars before but with mango it became 10 volume bars..
__label__0 Whenever i drag control from one treeview to another treeview it throws exception.
__label__0 If I use anywhere in my UWP app <BitmapIcon> with UriSource=about:blank this can happen when using databinding the app crashes when navigating to other page which contains WebView.
__label__0 I have added this whole ASN (AS8075 https://ipinfo.io/AS8075) to my windows firewall but after that it can only check that there is an update but for downloading it tried to connect to some akami IPs (according to windows firewall logs)

__label__1 Problem is there____s no way to easily manipulate this within a XAML app - I would hope that an SVG-renderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the HTML5 renderers use - I would not expect to use javascript/css classes to manipulate SVG from a XAML app but bonus points if XAML styles could be plugged in - Manual conversion to XAML is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets.
__label__0 From an old suggestion which got declined: - Phone off (locked) - Reminder comes up (reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped) - User taps over reminder, then unlocks: target app is not launched Expected: Tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app, just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up.

__label__0 If I add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediaSource.ExternalTimedMetadataTracks the crash happens when adding the track.
__label__0 This might require some processing on the part of Microsoft in the form of custom server processing of incoming and outgoing data, but Microsoft could add an additional charge for apps that take advantage of this feature to cover cloud computing/storage costs.

__label__1 The date drop down in the Windows Dev Center needs to have custom date so the developers can see the total download of their application of any interval they enter.
__label__0 Currently, it is not possible for us to release this feature for windows phone, too, and this makes our loyal WP fans frustrated... Hi, I think it's useful if both windows phone 8.x and windows 8.x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465199.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464978.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.knownfolders.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj218966.aspx In particular, having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API doesn't deliver a UX on par with other platforms.
__label__0 the API is too implicit it works on side-effect rather than deliberate commands.
__label__0 well it's really powerful for indie devs
__label__1 The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.
__label__1 Winjs could be modernized, streamlined and simplified as part of the open source project by providing only that functionality not now supported by ES6.
__label__0 It is used a lot, almost as much as the comma and full stop.
__label__0 My App has no choice 18+, submit audit, report feedback 18+, audit failure
__label__1 Please make an option to mark messages for windows phone 7.8
__label__0 The problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the On-Screen-Keyboard.
__label__0 There appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources.
__label__0 I want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device.
__label__1 There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.
__label__0 The Contact class is missing at least one data point, the Anniversary.
__label__0 This will be an excellent advantage compared with other options.
__label__0 The only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the app.
__label__0 I'm currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.
__label__0 This will benefit for applications which create audio, or recording voice, it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program.
__label__0 If I add a (x:Int32) case before the inner function I get a 'Functions cannot have other functions as parameters' error.
__label__0 Having to convert a .wav file to .wma or .mp3 format, for selection in the SaveRingtoneTask, is a very difficult process that involves web services and licensing considerations.
__label__0 Actually we can't because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application.
__label__1 When you select a preferred RL service, it should also be available when you long-press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service, rather than having to open the link, wait for it to load, then send it to Instapaper or Pocket or whatever you prefer.
__label__0 One way to do this is to provide an option to create a shortcut to the desktop when an application is open.
__label__0 Tested on Windows 10 Creators Update VS2017 15.2.

__label__0 VERBOSE: Getting all files under C:\vfs0
__label__1 Add integration with Toodledo
__label__0 Uf someone i know sends a mass sms or mms message and i am one of the recipients 1) It doesnt fall into that contact's conversation, it is separate, and i can see all the recipients.
__label__0 Also, I've heard that MS just warns those devs, but even lets them keep obvious fake max ratings.
__label__1 Evidently this is a limitation of the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() API - it should be fixed.
__label__0 FieldOfView is in degrees on W10 Mobile and in radians on Desktop.
__label__0 My app contains in-app purchases but customers can not buy these in-app purchases in the Windows Store for Business.
__label__0 Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread (for example Reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running)
__label__0 Just like the picture/music extras to be able to integrate in a persons/phone numbers(unkown caller)) So to add phone services to easy search for numbers or To be able to start a contact/message app from the contact card.
__label__1 We need override base keyboard, with adding custom keys.
__label__0 Compilation fails with error CS1061 in MainPage.g.cs: MainPage.MainPage_obj1_Bindings does not contain a definition for bindingsTracking and no extension method bindingsTracking accepting a first argument of type MainPage.MainPage_obj1_Bindings could be found.
__label__0 When you update an app and update the App tile icon and/or Background image, save the update as it is not working
__label__0 This means that applications that wish to use the capabilities of the BackgroundAgent are restricted to using only local audio files that are deployed with teh application, or audio streaming sources.
__label__1 So come on all the APIs are already there :) Give Windows Ink a boost.
__label__0 I hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers.
__label__0 Classic Win32 has the option to disable Windows key when using Direct Input and DISCL_NOWINKEY.
__label__0 All with the same original and translated text for all languages!
__label__0 For such a strategic move where the Windows Store could remain indigent as during the painful Windows 8.x era if nothing is done please make sure developers do not remain in the… more
__label__0 Thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else, I changed the name slightly.
__label__0 This tester changed the criteria.
__label__0 It's how I get notified that there is unread items while I am on the Mac.
__label__0 With a lot.
__label__0 And it's not because they are colliding with other MapIcons.
__label__0 3) Comment lines from 105 to 108 where serial device settins read.
__label__0 I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half (allowing for the SIP) a portrait or landscape screen.
__label__0 How's that for security?
__label__1 I believe that the 'app review' and 'report for developers' should be divided.
__label__0 Text boxes on the other hand have little handles attached to use for resizing.
__label__0 I'm wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read Twitter feeds in Feedly.
__label__0 If you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older Win 10 build will immediately crash.
__label__1 Please add.
__label__0 the podcast app in windows phone 8.1- if I stop a podcast and start another, the bookmark for the previous podcast goes away and I have to search to find where I left off on the first podcast.
__label__0 This is highly annoying for non contact numbers.
__label__1 add integration with Trello
__label__0 I am really sorry having bought this phone.
__label__0 It's even available in WPF via Math Input Control.
__label__0  But if you try to search for it, e.g. Announcements for Windows, the app is not listed.
__label__1 Could Feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to Evernote?
__label__1 Also, allow a YouTube video to continue to play while I scroll through the rest of my feeds.
__label__0 There is no option for hard and soft reset
__label__0 When watching videos I don't get audio through my bluetooth headphones, but I do when just listening to audio.
__label__0 Most probably you will have to collaborate with Google but this is the challenge!
__label__0 Lumia 720, WP 8.0.10328.78 Example: <html> <head> <style> .class1 > .class2 { background: blue; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=class1> Level1<div class=class2>Level2</div> </div> </body> </html>
__label__1 Atleast remove password for kidscorner or make another password for kidscorner.
__label__0 For example: to show the notification area, you swipe from left to right.
__label__1 You could rename the Windows 10 Mobile to Windows 10 Watch and you could stop making the Lumia mobile phones but you could start making Lumia Smartwatch with Windows 10 Watch
__label__1 PD: All Microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on Windows.
__label__0 Hey I have feedly notifier in firefox on windows 8.
__label__0 Evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the Chrome Evernote plugin to sign out the user and then Feedly takes you to a web page version of Evernote, rather than using the Evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web.
__label__0 currently it supposes to be reading all names from some dll files in the xap bundle,(if you have support for different languages) but it failed, and the name displayed in app store can actually harm the ranking of the app.
__label__0 I've done some tests and to my surprise DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD instead of bringing performance improvements it slows things down.
__label__0 Yesterday , my apps is normal.

But today, my apps could not find on store.
__label__1 Please allow us to maintain all app packages, store assets, descriptions, screenshots, and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload.
__label__1 Making it possible for us to write tests and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way.
__label__0 It's just one area that I can't recommend Windows Phones to people.
__label__1 A sample project for using Hawaii OCR API would be very helpful for the developers.Also need help with how to use image pre-processing techniques and supported image processing libraries on WP8 to improve OCR accuracy.
__label__0 Everyone in the USA has___ more
__label__0 In Windows App Store we can choose the price tier.
__label__1 It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.
__label__0 Creating a win win situation for readers and content creators.
__label__0 When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.
__label__1 I prefer to see original content most of the time) so along with mark as read / save links there could be URL link which will drive to the original site.
__label__1 For security reasons, I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi, then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone.
__label__0 I mean we can access system files, registry etc, Like we can do with our PC.
__label__0 We see an error CLASS_NOT_REGISTERED message.
__label__0 when I click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles I could open in new tabs.
__label__0 How is it that there is no Check All button for the list of email messages?
__label__0 For example the minimum requirements: Operating system: Windows 8 or later required
__label__0 I know it could be more plaisant, more colorfull, graphically improved, still better tuned to my real needs.
__label__0 The amount of spam applications, apps that are split out into several regions (i.e.
__label__0 So if I get a Cortana alert or new email and I'm playing CoD I can see it.
__label__1 Please, add SAP (Sim Access Protocol) Bluetooth protocol.
__label__0 This bug is easy to reproduce: var wbmp = new WriteableBitmap(480,640); await wbmp.SetSourceAsync(stream); //the stream comes from a picture with larger size, i.e.
__label__0 Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay.
__label__0 ReportInterval set to 1 second, the phone would regularly take 30 - 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to report.
__label__0 Even though I'm logged in to Google in the same browser, and I've already logged in to Feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants, it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days - why?
__label__1 It will be a good idea if you introduce a Trust Center OR maybe Trusted Apps, which requires more review form Microsoft before publishing maybe.
__label__0 Best practice until now:
__label__0 If we can see the current voltage level, we can determine if the phone is plugged in to USB power, or utilizing an induction charger.
__label__0 I'm aware that there's some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and sets functionality which allows people to continue where they left off but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the PC restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device.
__label__1 I would like to programmatically set and get the volume for Windows.
__label__1 Since you can integrate with Twitter, it would be nice to have my saved links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in Feedly.
__label__1 Create a better more fluently flowing weed strain app with better pictures and 3-D spinning pictures available too.
__label__0 Furthermore it'll have to be compatible with any RSS Feed i have in my list.
__label__1 you can limit number of apps according to the screen size.
__label__0 Like thousands of other developers I have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies.
__label__0 Find a store or anything else with bing search and import the name, adress, phone, mail into your kontakts.
__label__1 Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points, then re-run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission.
__label__0 It has become even more needed with the addition of WXGA and the different scalings in WP8.
__label__0 Now this is a mess.
__label__1 Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode panning other file formats could be supported?
__label__0 The inner exception that has sense is the System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException.
__label__0 This of course can already be found in WPF any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to UWP this would be a big boost.
__label__0 Below thr support mail As I suggested in my previous email please leave your feedback via the link below.
__label__0 I have been trying to encourage many of my friends to try making applications.
__label__0 At least we're not totally in the dark in a limbo where we don't know if the issue is just a transient one or… more
__label__0 Is there an actual reason you cannot share directly to Facebook/Twitter anymore?
__label__0 A few words about problem context:
__label__0 Originally this was supposed to be included in DirectX but later was scrapped.
__label__0 The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class.
__label__1 My suggestion is to make this interval configurable.
__label__0 Transferring large amounts of data (10kB) takes way to long when transferred via BLE using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large.
__label__1 Please enhance the new back up function (http://blog.feedly.com/2014/07/14/dropbox-vault/) and enable OneDrive as well!
__label__0 android ve __os daki new star soccer i getirin art__k
__label__0 Not all have international credit card to make payment of $ 99.
__label__1 Bring WebView with Edge to WPF and WinForms applications
__label__1 Make it available for .Net WPF also and via nuget.
__label__1 Please, provide Access to internal too.
__label__1 It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.
__label__1 The bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes.
__label__0 For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.
__label__0 So far i have tried three different apps and I cannot access my pre windows phone 8.1 photos.
__label__1 It would be awesome if for every app on the store instead of doing the traditional feedback system, we could do a collaborative system along the lines of uservoice.

That way users with similar thoughts would be grouped together, the developer would get a better idea of what people want, and users can see when developers have considered their feedback.
__label__0 2.- It's not possible to have an app in background that listens the communication channel.
__label__0 Most often it occurs near map borders.
__label__1 Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley.
__label__0 There are probably even more...
__label__0  at System.Management.Automation.LocationGlobber.IsChildNameAMatch(PSObject childObject
__label__0 As an example, we have a media player app for iOS, Android, Windows 8.1 that does some sound processing and mixing between mp3 files available in the library and the recording of the mic.
__label__0 This problem also happen randomly.
__label__0 The main scenario is MVVM and resolving a View from a ViewModel.
__label__1 A GrantAccountAccessTask could, for example, ask the user for temporary access (including what permissions are needed).
__label__0 I have cribbs about the lack of file transfer over bluetooth but the inability to play video and game sounds through a bluetooth headset is very, very lame..
__label__0 And some of important glyphs of 10240 are also lacked from the enumeration.
__label__0 Less apps = low cloud processing and data storage and less revenue.
__label__1 (An optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items.)
__label__0 I used Google Reader to get the best posts from many blogs and share them through my own Blog, hosted in Blogger.
__label__0 I love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation I have to get in touch with you guys and find the answers to these questions.
__label__1 Code would be useful in adapting to Bluetooth applications.
__label__0 Open the network + settings and tap on call settings.
__label__1 We recommend that you share this deeplink via social media or your website for promoting your app to the public.
__label__0 This problem also happen randomly.
__label__1 We would prefer it either to show the app's page in the store or to not be included in the results at all if it appears to create an error.
__label__1 If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and___ more
__label__0 Dear Dev Team!
__label__0 All the above is also somewhat possible today but there's no OS based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user.
__label__0 Current WP7 does not allow the keyboard to be replaced.
__label__0 Some RITs (resource intensive tasks) do not require comms and it is absurd to wait for connection to WiFi prior to running them.
__label__0 Save number / Contact SMS txt number rely You only have delete and block.
__label__0 This screws up my group metrics (e.g. count) and makes it annoying when sending out email blasts (commercial providers use recipients as a metric for billing).
__label__0 at the current release there are no possibility to see or delete the certificates, which were installed at the phone.
__label__0 Persona is made by the makers of the Firefox browser and Gravatar is made by WordPress.
__label__1 Add podcasts as new data resource in windows phone studio app website.
__label__0 After the 7.5 to 7.8 update I was so thankful that the arrow icon (the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page!!)
__label__1 That's why MarkdownTextBlock could offer a way to register some kind of callback function which is called whenever the control comes across a fenced code block with a specified language ID.
__label__0 1.____________________________________ 2.WiFi_______________________________WiFi________________ 3.__Ǖ___________________________________________________________
__label__0 Textbox that indicates Validation Results (This Filed is Required...)
__label__0 This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is___ more
__label__0 However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on Save, which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned.
__label__0 And I was impressed how far I got.
__label__0 Since 2009 the advent of Silverlight PivotViewer Control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data.
__label__1 Be responsible and give more & specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.
__label__0 Request for an editable combo box that allows:
__label__1 Allow the use of desktop keyboard to interact with WP8 emulator similar to the current mouse functionality.
__label__0 It does not show up with financial p;lanner either.
__label__0 We would like to register as a developer in Windows Store.
__label__0 Users don't like to wait, when they click on app.
__label__0 ShowAt show the flyout with the size (width) defined in the style However ShowAtAsync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style.

I think its a bug.

ShowAtAsync would be more convinient to use but we cannot as the flyout is not size according to its content, but to the width of the attached button.
__label__0 But on both Windows Phone 8 emulator and device (Nokia Lumia 920), there are 2 problems: - DownloadProgress property often returned 1.0 right after video if opened.
__label__0 This ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly.
__label__0 The restrictions on the calendar edit/delete are rediculous.
__label__0 If a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online - none!
__label__0 The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing!
__label__0 Google Reader had the option Send to > Blogger.
__label__0 For example the HTC Mozart microphone sample frequency is fixed as 16000 Hz.
__label__0 If my mobile is part of a PBX I need to transfer calls between another phones on the PBX.
__label__0 It is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is'nt Show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by Name.

__label__0 It keeps hanging after I login.
__label__0 A DNS-SD service registration does not respond to mDNS queries having a class of ANY but only responds to queries having a class of IN.
__label__0 go back to windows 8 windows 10 is **** .... to tell you the truth you just made it more complicated and its not user friendly
__label__0 Cuz when we navigate away from IE to an app, the back to IE, we can't navigate to the previous website.
__label__0 Would be awesome if you could fix this :)
__label__0 On the other hand, if my goal is as much common code as possible, I'm forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator, crippling all of the other platforms.
__label__0 I noticed several of my Facebook pages weren't updating and then saw this announcement that Facebook has stopped updating RSS feeds.
__label__1 I need a way to remove files from my WP8 device which have been disliked.
__label__0 Tested in both c++ and c#.
__label__0 It appears there is a Enter File Name even when selecting an existing file using FileSavePicker on UWP mobile.

__label__0 App language is English (FlowDirection: LTR)
__label__0 So that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us.
__label__0 That said, as a podcast player, Feedly leaves a lot to be desired.
__label__0 (related UV suggestion: http://wpdev.uservoice.com/suggestions/4328935 ) Not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the VS list.
__label__0 We have implemented a FastObservableCollection (see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/blob/8e11fda46dccb487787dc955a79b194c26ac15e0/src/Catel.MVVM/Catel.MVVM.Shared/Collections/FastObservableCollection.cs#L438)
__label__0 There is an indirect way of using BrowserHttp but it's kinda buggy.
__label__1 Add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray.
__label__0 and an easy way to implement is to do this (asides from Bing Translating): ****************************************** Wonderful App Name ***** 200 user reviews worldwide **** 3 reviews in your market *************************************** This way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews.
__label__1 Please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working?
__label__0 And the interest for MS would be obvious.
__label__0 They have a great launcher Cortana Outlook Office for mobile and so on.
__label__1 I couldn't find any option in Feedly Extension to turn this off, So I've turned background apps off in Chrome, but would rather this be an option in Feedly
__label__0 If you shot a photo on native camera (Microsoft Camera) and see the photo on the app, it don't delete a photo when you pick delete.
__label__1 On Feedly Android App, when I share something through email, it goes straight to Gmail app, when I rather want to use the Regular Email App on that plataform.
__label__1 Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low-level Direct2D for rich text rendering capabilities.
__label__0 Currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation.
__label__0 It'll save you a lot of typing, looking_____ more
__label__0 Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I'm considering this a bug.
__label__0 Support told me he does not know how to fix it (the problem).
__label__0 It's so powerful and still human readable.
__label__0 More info: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/955ce7d3-3828-408a-91ec-352708f26f6d/improve-the-store-search-results-by-placing-more-emphasis-on-keywords?forum=wpsubmit In my view, the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows: 1.
__label__1 Please add simple API:
__label__0 Several developers have managed to coax out the private API used to implement this feature in a desktop app (see <https://withinrafael.com/2018/02/01/adding-acrylic-blur-to-your-windows-10-apps-redstone-4-desktop-apps/>); however this API is officially unsupported can change at any time and has been changed in a backwards-incompatible manner once in the past.
__label__0 Then, when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect, it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud___ more
__label__1 I belive that Store should control the SDK level more grained.
__label__0 After a firmware update for my phone I was unable to retrieve folders/files from a token.
__label__0 Just like on desktop IE.
__label__0 Now on Windows Phone 8 when we have 3 resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time.
__label__0 I'm using your Chrome app.	
__label__0 I use my phone with left hand, and feedly was great, thumb would scroll, swipe, touch to open articles.
__label__1 Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.
__label__0 Right now it is very difficult (and completely undocumented) to determine if a photo or picture is marked as a favorite by a user, or to retrieve a list of favorites (similar to getting the list of pictures in the KnownFolders.CameraRoll, etc).
__label__1 I drag the url to my feedly bookmark, and Feedly adds the feed to my account (even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as I add it).
__label__0 If this is a privacy constraint then… more
__label__0 Like cacert.org for instance.
__label__1 And it can be made 100% backwards compatible with Height property in Pixels.
__label__0 And I have a connected app that benefits from fast low latency networks but can work with a larger buffer if need be.
__label__0 I created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community (don't remember how I got there) and was very surprised never to get an answer... until I realized you guys worked in user voice...
__label__0 In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.
__label__1 Please fix that anoying issue.
__label__1 I would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me.
__label__0 Linked to GitHub https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit/issues/821
__label__0 I already know workarounds using Bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect (a binding is not a transcoding/conversion they are different by nature).
__label__0 An native app that permit to open files in .rar and .zip formats.
__label__0 With Silverlight in Windows Phone i had the ability to use FM radio APIs.
__label__1 if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark(s) associated with them).
__label__0 So although in, e.g., .NET-based store apps, the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events, there doesn't appear to be any point to this at the moment because you___ more
__label__0 So the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down
__label__1 I didn't see anyone else suggest this but I would think it would be very simple for Flip Board to add support for your service.
__label__1 Enable iOS devices to be included in a user’s device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices
__label__1 Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want.
__label__0 isn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?
__label__0 Identify cell and BTS connected, RSCP,CPICH RSSI and EcNo, pathloss, (...), Wifi RSSI/strength
__label__0 it would be helpfull to have a passwordBox like control which supports Number only keyboard.
__label__0 As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy.
__label__1 Add support for Office to directly send presentation to wireless projector.
__label__1 Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low-level Direct2D for rich text rendering capabilities.
__label__1 Can you please add an IAP which would have a recurring payment (automatically charge user monthly / annually / etc)?
__label__1 Get back the Offiline Symbols download
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 I know Microsoft already has the digital ink recognition technology for math formulas.
__label__0 For example: 1.
__label__1 Please add a way to get a storyboard is paused.
__label__0 Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited.
__label__0 Increases richness of User Interface.

__label__1 I need to write to a bitmap which is very painful (imagine a vnc client for example) on windows phone right now, so please support the Copy- and WritePixels methods and some others.
__label__0 I have lots of apps that are just now showing that they… more
__label__0 Wrong text display when write an English(LTR) word inside an Persian(Farsi) or Arabic(RTL) text(See Picture) when APP language et to English( 
__label__0 simple.
__label__0 Edge Browser, VS 2015 and VS Code already provides support for ES6.
__label__0 Hello I want to protect some user-mode code and read only data against other user-mode modification from a kernel-mode driver while allowing process handle creation.
__label__0 after every 3 words or so my phone will put the first letter into a capitol and words such as go and others it just puts it completely into capitols, this is soo annoying and getting on my nerves, pls fix/allow for more settings for this asap
__label__0 The other way would be to invoke the scanner from my application as for the web search.
__label__0 However, not all devices are compatible, and the emulator images take up a large amounts of space and take lengthy times to download.
__label__0 Being able to prepare an MMS for the user would have many usages, and the functionality are readily available on other platforms.
__label__1 also would like to see when exactly a listing was updated.
__label__0 Now, that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot, so you modify that with ratings.
__label__0 Besides making it easier for Android/iOS devs to port to Windows through the bridges, I think you can think of making it easier for devs starting with Windows to easily port the apps to Android/iOS as well.

For example you can buy Xamarin and make it free, or develop a bridge to help share C# code with Android/iOS.
__label__0 Our App would crash.
__label__0 Is this maybe a typo in the documentation?
__label__0 This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway.
__label__1 trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll/pan in UWP (C#) like many web ui component as superscrollrama.js
__label__0 Developers wishing to leverage the Zune media platform to offer improved or tailored podcast playback experiences are currently blocked.
__label__0 We are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests.
__label__0 Lots of blogs contains LaTeX code, to display mathematical characters.
__label__0 It was suppose to show afther this the Windows Hello Settings page for finguerprint detection( as is in the normal Windows 10 Windows Hello Settings page).
__label__0 Out of city where e71 had normally 4 bars, the L925 gets 1 bar and often even loses that, saying no signal.
__label__0 open up to more platforms to make this phone actually works with the project my phone feature
__label__0 On Windows, there does not appear to be a way to add a PasswordCredential object to the PasswordVault with roaming disabled.
__label__0 is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show, how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte).
__label__0 A designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that XAML.
__label__0 I've also posted the full exception there.
__label__1 It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.
__label__0 The item will adapt its height to the content.
__label__0 However, it NEVER gets good visibility because it isn't the best, which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions.
__label__0 Eagerly waiting on connection with Evernote!
__label__0 Although the Native Screenshot feature is reported to not be available until Windows Phone 8, I have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact Windows Phone 7 apps as well.
__label__1 Letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publisher's feed.
__label__0 i think it's good that 3th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc...
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files, In this case i wanna suggest you that you can make Windows Phone 7 fully unlock option, Means if any user want to unlock Windows Phone 7 then he/she can unlock it.
__label__1 Also, it would be really useful to have an apostrophe available on the main text entry screen.
__label__0 But RenderTargetBitmap API doesn't work in Background.
__label__0 I know you cannot speak to other search methodologies but I need to understand why yours is so different.
__label__0 When assigning app licenses in the Windows Store for Business (WSfB) end-users always get notified.
__label__0 Hyper-V is a powerful VM management tool, and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them, allowing developers to save the current state of the VM (e.g., to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it, either for one app or multiple) or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the VM.
__label__0 However, there is no built in method to save a WriteableBitmap as a png.
__label__1 So my suggestion is to offer developers a switch to turn on/off pro features in the sandbox.	
__label__1 I'd like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker.
__label__0 In IE10-11, every news line is effectively 2 lines; 1 line for the title, then the 1st line of the article starts AND goes on for a full 2nd line.
__label__0 See my example implementation here: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/7aeb4791-3f5b-4e18-93be-0b6191cf6b72/code-snippet-storagefoldercopyfolder-method?forum=winappswithhtml5
__label__0 With Mango this is not possible anymore when having one-time-generated urls.
__label__0 One way to do this is to provide an option to create a shortcut to the desktop when an application is open.
__label__1 It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than 100KB (1 MB at least) this would prevent us from having to depend on a network/paid service to have great cross-device customer experiences.
__label__0 More I earn, more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps.
__label__0 Windows Media Player can play .mid files for a very long time but Groove Music App cannot because WinRT does not have API to play MIDI file.
__label__0 when planning a new agenda item for example this is done nicely.
__label__0 I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator.
__label__1 Please modify like this. 
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to specify an ItemsSource and automatically populate it with MVVM.
__label__0 if I catch a generic Exception, obtain this exception message: Object reference not set to an istance of an object in row : LiveLoginResult result =___ more
__label__0 It's just one area that I can't recommend___ more
__label__0 This function is currently available in the Gmail and Pocket iOS apps, in which a button appears at the top left corner of the Chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to Feedly when they view a page in Chrome from Feedly.
__label__0 Currently some Tasks exhibit this behaviour and some do not.
__label__1 An attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a Xaml Control.
__label__0 the phone language and settings are UK english.
__label__0 Furthermore, isn't 1'200 for fullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours very good for a two year old battery?
__label__0 See the data piling up in the following stores:
__label__1 I would love to have direct integration so that I can easily send articles to SoundGecko from within the Feedly app.
__label__0 the photo is reserve use camare
__label__0 Since the SemanticZoom is subscribed to the BackRequested event if I navigate to another page and press the back button the BackRequested event is not called on my navigated page since it is handled by the SemanticZoom in the previous page even if page caching is disabled for the Frame.
__label__0 Video size is ~1GB so it must take long time to get 1.0 value.
__label__0 I have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action.
__label__1 It would be helpful if we have an equivalent API available in C++.
__label__1 To do so it is crucial we can remove the Close button or complete TitleBar from the TabTip keyboard.
__label__0 It degrades browsing quality and I'm unable to create a new browser which can fix this issue.
__label__1 Can Feedly's RSS parser be made to not break this functionality please?
__label__0 Or perhaps you have a tile that shows you where you are--restarurant or wherever--and you simply tap it to check in there.
__label__0 appxupload), ________________________ ________________ (________________ 1.1.3.0 Table_ _x86_x64_arm_bundle.
__label__0 But clicking on tile still work's - calendar opens.
__label__1 Feedly could re-invent the way we consume articles in the same way how Amazons Kindle Unlimited did with the book market.
__label__0 This package does always crash after side loading it.
__label__0 When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names.
__label__1 Please fix it.
__label__0 But I noticed that it still happens no sound issue in another situation.
__label__0 The combination of toasts and Action Center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users but after notifications are read they disappear.
__label__0 I dont want lose my account, my account will expires at 07.2014, because i open this account with student verification.
__label__0 every 15 sec ONLY when subscribed to Geolocator's StatusChanged/PositionChanged; works fine otherwise.
__label__0 Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles).
__label__0 I request that the MultiScaleImage library to be able to access isolated storage.
__label__0 I like the feedly interface more than the Instapaper interface.
__label__1 MediaElement should properly work with 5.1 audio tracks.
__label__0 Notepad has been updated to support Line endings from Unix Linux and Mac.
__label__1 Please reduce required permission for chrome extension.
__label__0 I believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken, but I only remember these 4 because I ported a very simple app.
__label__0 This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth___ more
__label__0 browsing on the market place every day we discover new apps, if you want to buy these ones at a later time or just want to have more time to download the app.
__label__0 My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP in the same submission.
__label__1 It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.
__label__1 It would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise.
__label__1 Have an option to make items open directly in the Chrome Browser on mobile
__label__0 Unfortunately we can't set the MapControl language by programming to a specific value.
__label__0 This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.
__label__0 Presently one cannot print in UWP without invoking the print dialog.
__label__0 I use Direct2D to render complex shapes and animations.
__label__0 Native .
__label__0 Currently the only way to set BackgroundDownloader's header is by SetHeader method unfortunately once you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method:
__label__1 The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI and  Services  ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.
__label__0 I have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).
__label__0 Expected behavior:
__label__0 Once this client part is done  we can have rest api's returning json data while maintaining session on server .
__label__0 And I was impressed how far I got.
__label__0 The CommandBar in the Page body works as expected.
__label__0 Because the page doesn't change to reflect the drop operation was successful I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth.
__label__0 When a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed.
__label__0 Some RITs that ARE comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion.
__label__1 Can you please fully unlock windows phone 7.
__label__0 All GPS-App in the store have the same problem with the jumping altitude.
__label__0 I have added this whole ASN (AS8075 https://ipinfo.io/AS8075) to my windows firewall but after that it can only check that there is an update but for downloading it tried to connect to some akami IPs (according to windows firewall logs)
__label__0 But that has a very big impact on maintenance because we would have to support 2 apps.
__label__1 Please add few enhancements so it accepts HTML also or add a converter which may help developers.
__label__1 Apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface!
__label__1 The reason why its a good idea to add a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML setup the FontSize FontFamily and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly 10 lines.
__label__0 (Windows 8.0 projects, when updated to Windows 8.1 projects, lose their ability to support Windows 8.0!)
__label__0 Package acceptance validation error: You don't have permissions to specify the following namespaces in the appx manifest file of the package QYPlayer_1.1.0.0_x86.appx: http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities
__label__0 if the <DataTemplate x:DataType=models:LocalStatus> references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile.
__label__0 -_____ more
__label__0 Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.
__label__0 The UWP application platform has a rich media API which allows querying of a video device (e.g.
__label__0 On the WinPho8.1 video, it works like Android and iOS.
__label__1  For example developers can hide those built-in buttons and draw their own ones and call CoreWindow.Minimize() CoreWindow.Maximize etc.
__label__1 If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL2 glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs.
__label__0 It's just one area that I can't recommend Windows Phones to people.
__label__0 I am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or OS -- the idea of a seamless experience between Windows desktop and Android or iOS mobile is compelling... but I need to see some examples before I invest.
__label__0 All the documentation on how to call UWP methods are in C# and require the .NET platform.
__label__0 We have the photochoosertask which works great and does the job, but we do not have access to music on the device.
__label__0 Advanced audio APIs would allow developers to create music applications for musicians, etc.
__label__0 Lumia 925 running on wp8.1 with all the updates has extremely bad gsm (both 3g and 4g) signal reception.
__label__0 more and more people telephone over voip but there are many different provider.
__label__1 Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.
__label__0 Today I can't instantiate a Mappolygon in an ItemControl from XAML.
__label__0 This means the task can not execute for the full 15 minute window.
__label__0 An API that would take 5 minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding
__label__0 So often the png splash screen is larger than all of the app's compiled code.
__label__0 Currently a file is simply flagged as deleted.
__label__0 There doesnt seem to be any website for this.
__label__1 Please add this feature.
__label__1 Make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper (representing application )high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui Now many apps has simply ugly icons,pixelated,Android like ,pirated ,misleading,..
__label__0 An example https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/search?q=fb+pages+manager+pro Searching for the app fullname appears a bunch of junk and unrelated apps first and only after the actual app with the search terms...
__label__0 Haven installed the Feedly extension, I did notice that I has some weird tab that decided to add itself.
__label__0 It is needed when displaying text on pictures.
__label__0 Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost.
__label__0 I am using this app for my iPad and yours for the iPhone and Laptop.
__label__0 You see a ad for a pair a shoe you want.
__label__0 This problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case.
__label__0 Probably not looked in the correct place yet.
__label__0 See this thread for an example: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/bb5aa859-e3d1-46f2-a661-d4bdbee9a1f2/windowsuixamlmediaimagebrush?forum=winappswithcsharp
__label__1 The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification.
__label__0 If a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites, we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications.
__label__1 The idea is simple: open a marketplace for developers only where devs can submit applications developed with an extended API, which allows to access to more information/capabilities on the device.
__label__1 on the taskbar setting in the item hide taskbar wish I could ask for the task bar appears only when the CTRL button is pressed and so when I use windows and want the bar to appear as well as position the mouse where she is hides the CTRL button must be pressed
__label__1 I'd also be happy if MapTileSource property changes (like Bounds) were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back (this is how it can be done currently).
__label__0 Even if you disabled it using
__label__0 Is there a way to toggle this automatic feature?
__label__0 I think Microsoft provide Azure cloud computing free for developer.
__label__0 Therefore it is for the app / game developer much more important to have a good fill rate.
__label__0 It needs to be and integrated part of the phones functionality, that is why I put it in Framework.
__label__0 This will make tiles truly live and open up the live of WP7 to new applications.
__label__1 This can be really helpful if you want to easily create a Multi-Lingual Cortana Experience if you use RESW.
__label__0 Found BSOD(0xe6) occurred.FR:1/50
__label__0 As well as a RESW File Code Generator (Or RESX) and a tool like the MultiLingual Toolkit.
__label__0 Keyboard is nice but when you do landscape mode on the keyboard the whole screen is not covered by the keyboard the status bar sort of shortens the keyboard so it would be nice if the status bar didn't interfere 10.
__label__1 I'd suggest to include all Transactions in the Report.
__label__0 API connectivity to all Google Apps for Work.

__label__0 First is there any way to get this to work?
__label__0 appointments have a RemoteId but calendars don't.
__label__0 The wireless card worked well till windows 7.
__label__0 This System for featuresuggestion is good, but I miss the feedback to the feedback.
__label__1 Please allow private developers to access those capabilities.
__label__0 I'm using a tablet with Win 10 Pro build 1709
__label__1 I believe that everyone in XAML lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.
__label__1 Contract this with the Windows Phone world, where we tell you we want trial mode, but we have to track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
__label__0 When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.
__label__1 This should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps.
__label__1 While I was building a web application, I've noticed that single page applications with this url: http://www.contoso.com/!#/ will display blank page and only a refresh will load the page again can you please check that?
__label__0 Same for tumblr, twitter and facebook.
__label__0 One Exception where a folder can't be added:
__label__0 My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP___ more
__label__0 Having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed.
__label__1 I want to create windows service which runs in background and checks if any bar-code is scanned whenever a bar-code is scanned I want the windows service to handle it and write the input to the text file.

__label__1 Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge too ?
__label__0 (yuryastv@gmail.com) The last week it became impossible to work with all of my submissions.
__label__1 Bring back 1 tap saving to Pocket in iOS Apps.
__label__0 With an ISO14443 Smartcard support, you would be able to communicate with Smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via NFC Credit Cards.
__label__0 I have a great app idea going but I am missing one feature, the ability to upload music.
__label__0 the encrypted dabase file generated by WPDT can't be open with VS2010 or SQL server 2008.Hope you can fix this
__label__0 Hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone.
__label__1 Perhaps a similar situation could be made with feedly.
__label__1 I suggest do it like it is done in the Google Reader Watcher (http://ajnasz.hu/google-reader-watcher).
__label__1 Allow copy&paste in settings pages for path instructions AND especially in Failure/Error outcomes ... for self repair fix research/lookups.

__label__0 Hi , Currently dev have no option to render its own Pdf with text and images.
__label__0 I manage the images, files and resources using my own toolset, so I need to be able to create a cursor from that data.
__label__1 2) If you have such limits publish them in the API docs.
__label__0 Do you not have the proper agreements in place?
__label__0 Thanks!
__label__1 Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third-party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages.
__label__0 Will this feature included in WP8?
__label__0 Pinch and zoom out and scroll through slides.
__label__1 Implement a free app of the week deal like apple does with ios
__label__0 Making it possible to change iso in Video mode.
__label__1 Feel free to add the ability for extra apps as that's a requested feature and please keep adding_____ more
__label__0 It will make UWP more powerful like win32 and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps like Universal Copy and 'Native Clipboard .
__label__1 Following data would be great:
__label__1 Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions.
__label__0 This would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs.
__label__0 The keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches (particularly in the desktop Zune application) would, if ranked by frequency, provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts.
__label__0 Imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call, the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him/her.
__label__1 I pick up a contact we both know, I'd like to be able to push it to her phone.
__label__1 User should be able to style the Carousel items like we do for ListViewItems/ListBoxItems.
__label__1 It will be a good idea if you introduce a Trust Center OR maybe Trusted Apps, which requires more review form Microsoft before publishing maybe.
__label__0 If you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working.
__label__0 WCF discovery not supported in Windows Phone.
__label__0 Not for any of the datetime controls anyway (DatePicker CalenderView etc.
__label__0 .
__label__0 PC apps are harder to find this way.
__label__0 My app (Freda) is an ebook reader which has been popular and much-downloaded ever since 2010 - and it's appeared always in the top 5 results for a store search for 'ebook reader'.
__label__0 To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF… more
__label__0 In WP8, the default Pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the PhoneFontFamilySemiBold and PhoneFontSizeMedium styles, but the standard blank page template still uses PhoneTextNormalStyle (which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size) for the page title.
__label__0 From time to time, our university also likes to submit applications which are in most of the cases not fully grown products but tech demos or prototypes.
__label__1 ALL WINDOWS PHONES WITH TOUCH-SENSITIVE BUTTONS SHOULD VIBRATE!
__label__0 while tried to integrate through wcf its not responding.
__label__0 I am looking after a solution already over a decade for 3D mouses working over Windows Remote Desktop Connection.
__label__0 We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted.
__label__0 -> It sounds normally after reboot OS.
__label__0 We can get the contact(s) details[First Name,Last Name,Image,Email ID,Mobile Number etc] stored in the phone but not the group details like [Group Name,Member Count,Member Name(s)].
__label__0 They know to make it !
__label__0 With the new Windows UI Library now in pre-release.
__label__0 Thanks Since the Screen times out after option has the maximum time for only 5 minute and as a consumer perspective it's okay, but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the Visual Studio shows the message like: The application could not be launched for debugging.
__label__0 Feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client.
__label__0 I am considering future options for puchasing devices.
__label__0 The other developers try to force customers to use their software for example M$ with Edge and Paint 3D.
__label__1 Generate revenue for Microsoft through selling the application in the app store 2.
__label__0 The VM is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses; however it is unable to resolve names on either the public… more
__label__0 Despite being built to appear as a single-page app clicking pretty much any link in Dev Dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns.
__label__0 As soon this gets in to market due to the ease of development this should boom which eventually kill browser like chrome there angular concept thus again giving Microsoft a opportunity to beat others
__label__1 Now my idea: All controls could have a default property for localization.
__label__0 Certain WP8 phones have wireless or inductive charging, and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers.
__label__0 Other platforms (iOS and Android do support this!!!!!).
__label__0 If there is no api to access this information enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting.
__label__1 I would love to have this Feature Added to Windows PHone 10.

It will be really useful to use the PC's internet instead of turning on Wifi Everytime for Most people who use Either Modes or Broadband Cable lines.

Please Consider making it!!!

__label__1 Allowing a trusted 3rd_____ more
__label__0 I handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using DirectX rendering.
__label__0 If the user uninstalls during a trial, it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
__label__0 Windows Phone Silvelight XAPs were signed, so anyone donwloading them through the Store (manual download) could not have easy access to the sources of the app.

Now with Universal apps / WinRT (.

appx), our binaries are not longer signed as a whole, any script kiddie can unzip and decompile any app.
__label__0 Look it up.
__label__0 Currently I know of developers creating___ more
__label__0 This in driving mode activated.
__label__0 Intuitively, if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular, and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name.
__label__0 I can add only a style + behavior or create a custom control for it.
__label__0 Probably the biggest question I have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user.
__label__0 I think that has an overall negative effect -user wise, community wise and dev wise.. Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it.
__label__0 But this details are available in BATTERY USE settings
__label__0 ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.
__label__1 Why not allow a black background with white text when reading e-mail conversations?
__label__0 3
__label__0 When initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field.
__label__0 For me, it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser, it brings Chrome to the foreground and opens the link I tapped in a new tab.
__label__1 It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page, so you could specify one at the top, left, bottom or right.
__label__1 It would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask, in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask .
__label__0 This will bring compatibility of the currently available smart watches such as Pebble and MetaWatch and help start-up companies develop their own accessories and bring it to Windows Phone.
__label__0 Steps to reproduce: 1. send an email from gmail web interface with word ________ as subject 2. download the email using phone default client (the subject is shown correctly) 3. press reply (subject is still correct) 4. send the email 5. check Sent folder - subject is displayed as ????
__label__0 Infinite loop reproduction.
__label__0 ...to show a map of satellites contributing to the fix
__label__0 Same for debugging webpage;
__label__1 remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen
__label__0 Perhaps at least press+hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu.
__label__0 I am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps.
__label__1 Login should go through the Google account stored on the Android device.
__label__0 We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.
__label__0 Currently I have to save a MP3 stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP.
__label__0 Could do something like:
__label__1 It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request) and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms.
__label__0 2, More events support for WebView: for example, gesture support 3, Allowing third-party Apps to processing the network input/output, like handling CSS/Javascript files/image files/stream files.
__label__0 Allowing the execution of all apps in background like in android and ios ,when offline mix is kept for downloading in nokia mixradio,it pauses if we use any other apps.
__label__1 Please make sure the P/Invoke either points to a Windows API allowed in UWP applications or a native DLL that is part of the package.
__label__0 It doesn't increase the wish to develope the product.
__label__0 Today we have the x:DefaultBindMode attribute to define the default binding mode generated for a compiled data binding created with x:Bind.
__label__1 It would be good to not have to link to Twitter to get a usable URL;
__label__0 You can find it here: https://github.com/ericwilligers/svg-animation But the web animation standard is NOT a declarative language for animations, you still need SMIL to describe animations in browsers.
__label__1 Ideally if Feedly and BeyondPod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent!
__label__0 ______________________________________(WAV______)__________________________________________________________________________Ǖ______API_________________________________ ___________________________________________________________
__label__0 It seems wp8.1 does not backup and then restore all the apps.
__label__0 Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after 15 days if the application is not opened.
__label__1 It would be nice if Microsoft released Windows Phone 8.1 update 2 for the developer preview, because it would be nice to use the latest version, especially since windows Phone 10 is still unfinished.
__label__0 if the kid swipes right correctly at first - then no issue.
__label__1 It would be great if feedly would provide the current count of unread articles to TeslaUnread, which would show that number in the corner of the app icon on Nova Launcher.

__label__0 Furthermore, isn't 1'200 for fullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours very good for a two year old battery?
__label__1 There should be a PowerShell prompt in Device Portal that lets me run extra commands.
__label__1 In BYOD concept , block the user from the OS update.
__label__0 Rss hub synced with a new live service (like google reader) and outlook or ie Sync favorites bookmarks between ie mobile, desktop and a new live service
__label__0 Adding the following four lines to a report, that probably has been sent out thousands of times, would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading: ---------------------- This might help with Dark/Light theme problems: - - (Visibility)Application.Current.Resources[PhoneDarkThemeVisibility]; or similar - (Brush)Application.Current.Resources[PhoneBackgroundBrush]; ---------------------- and maybe additional links to documentation It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.
__label__0 Kindly i urge you to look at this matter.
__label__1 Add a control that reminds users to rate your UWP app after a certain amount of time or app launches.
__label__1 Give us an implementation of RadialGradientBrush that automatically uses acceleration when available.
__label__0 Cheers, Alan M Hi All, Apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong place!
__label__1 You should give people more freedom and more APIs to create new browsers.
__label__0 Think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something.
__label__0 Black background in the e-mail view.
__label__0 Eric Willigers from Google has created the official SMIL polyfill implemented entirely on the Web Animations API.
__label__0 When dropping down the 'Apply Filters' area, I change the options and nothing changes in the review listing below.

There doesn't seem to be a way to make the new selections take effect.
__label__0 But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).
__label__0 FAS reduces the changes of applications Tombstoning but it still needs to be handled.
__label__0 However we can't do the same thing in map control or in photos app.
__label__0 It is good that you started this unification with the common core!
__label__0 One of the problems I encounter is my inability to get Jack Info as in IKsJackDescription::GetJackDescription()
__label__0 Please fix this.
__label__0 If you push this button, start camera app and starting search QR-code.
__label__0 Facebook, other third party services.
__label__0 But SQLCipher is not - it supports only commercial edition ($899) and I can't afford the expense.
__label__0 Yes my internet upload speed is slow, but the site should function for slow upload speeds also, why not.
__label__1 Could Microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full-screen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name?
__label__0 Why?
__label__0 But let us say I visited the bicycle page, from Google, and want to search for...sunglasses ...to buy when I go to town anyway....the search in IE is yet again the Bing thing.
__label__0 Because it can't link with Andriod , IOS , and even WP7
__label__0 It would better allow me to judge the effectiveness of my marketing.
__label__0 There must be a bug some place in the framework.
__label__0 FileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension.
__label__0 All the saved and live data are saved on onedrive to allow roaming between the devices.
__label__1 I would like to schedule a job to 'POST' a url every 10min to keep alive UNTANGLE authentication.
__label__0 currently when you miss a toast notification, you have no way to check what it was..
__label__0 This led to a runtime crash that took a long time to figure out.
__label__0 That is very inconvenient so it would be great if the audio route is always in sync between the fm radio and media library.
__label__0 Is very useful for sharing feeds, using it with wordpress blogrolls, ecc...
__label__0 So that we can perform some other function within our app on the basis of notification type means call,don't call, end call.
__label__0 I assume the catalog is hanging for a moment while loading data, however there is no indicator and the result is a jerky experience.
__label__1 Better music player, I like the Zune on interface or Xbox music interface but I would like it so you can do more customization with it and have it so we can move a scroller on the bar that tells you how many minutes have you been playing the song, so that we can skip through the music to our favorite part 6.
__label__0 Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone ___ that___ more
__label__0 It is imperative for certain apps that some form of persistent background connectivity be allowed.
__label__0 As such I can't capture the gameplay occurring in my game.
__label__0 Once you create a CoreIndependentInputSource touch visual feedback is visible again.
__label__1 Please make the (Fluent) design toolkits available for Affinity Designer.
__label__0 This way, I can pull up the YouTube app on my phone or tablet later and watch these videos on my Chromecast.
__label__0 2, More events support for WebView: for example, gesture support 3, Allowing third-party Apps to processing the network input/output, like handling CSS/Javascript files/image files/stream files.
__label__0 Recently very excited to jump to Windows 8.1 Pro from Dev on my Samsung Series 7 Slate tablet.
__label__0 I do really like the idea of contract in windows 8.
__label__0 It's great that the Dev Center now allows multiple users to access the same account, and I can submit app packages as a user with the developer role: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt489008.aspx.

However, it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in Visual Studio.
__label__0 That's ridiculous there's no way to check vibrate mode until SDK 7.1.1!
__label__0 It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing, specially ones that you just had to create because___ more
__label__0 In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.
__label__1 Please don't Kill 512 ram devices in the future with new update.. Also ios7.1 still use full 800mhz cpu and it's still good.. Use some file paging on internal rom but don't Kill the performance please
__label__0 Of course they can come back, but they'll have to re-pay the registration fee again, and when being banned again every week, it won't pay out for them anymore.
__label__0 Microsoft does not have it's own direction navigation app.
__label__0 It seems StorageFolder.CreateFolder does not support multi-segment path.
__label__1 If the SDK could run on OSX I'd be actually able to create apps for WP7 :)
__label__0 It's been over four years since that post from Shawn Oster, it's time to get this into the platform.
__label__0 The Contact class is missing at least one data point, the Anniversary.
__label__1 My suggestion is to add an option to pin the application in use, for future use, when an application is open.
__label__1 Please add ability to Remove Azure AD association.
__label__0 Hi Super fastest calling with Home Button Shortcut NOKIA Symbian: just press key 2 on LOCKED screen for 2 seconds, for phone call (profile change, etc....run application) WINDOWS: ...........

Why can i NOT assign to-run-application for some BUTTON on locked screen...?

Why can i NOT assign to-run-application for some SCREEN-REGION on locked screen...?
__label__1 It would be great to have the ability to hide all apps/categories in with Windows Store and only have it show the Private App store.
__label__0 This option is already present in the desktop variant of the app, but missing in the mobile app.
__label__0 De una buena vez quiten la interfaz Metro, se ve bien desde una app de escritorio, pero en el m__vil es horrible.
__label__0 Downloading from the web is a very common thing to do in Apps but it doesn't have any dedicated control for it.
__label__0 It is best if photos can be processed on OneDrive.
__label__1 So what I suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might cause.And then user can decide to install the app or not.
__label__0 If the app EVER had an IAP, it is not eligible for transfer.
__label__0 Both TimePicker and TimePickerFlyout support Hour and Minute and Period (AM / PM) selection.
__label__0 When I click a customer group to manage it opens in a new window unlike most of the other links in the dashboard.
__label__1 So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat like as WPF .NET Framework.
__label__0 Sample html: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=utf-8> <title>text-align</title> <style> div { border: 1px solid black; /* __________________ __________ */ padding: 5px; /* ________ ____________ ____________ */ margin-bottom: 5px; /* ____________ __________ */ } #left { text-align: left; } #right { text-align: right; } #center { text-align: center; } .content { font-size: 20px; width: 75%; /* ____________ ________ */ background: #fc0; /* ________ ________ */ } </style> </head> <body> <div id=left><div class=content>________________________ ____ ____________ ________</div></div> <div id=center><div class=content>________________________ ____ ____________</div></div> <div id=right><div class=content>________________________ ____ ______________ ________</div></div> </body> </html> Third row is displayed incorrectly Phones: emulator vs, lumia 800, trophy version OS: 7.1 I found a problem with displaying html in the built-in browser (IE) windows phone 7.
__label__1 I would like to write Business Applications that get started when the phone is turned on and have as much control as a running app.. An idea would be having the phone snap pictures periodically and then uploading them..
__label__0 To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu, as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'.
__label__0 But it is not available by default.
__label__1 It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input.
__label__0 There are few websites with 2 letter domain name and IE doesn't store cookies for this domains.
__label__0 One way to do this would be to add such an option when a user right clicks on the application icon on the top left of the window.
__label__0 Since this is a Microsoft technology (or, at least, I thought it was), I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone 8.
__label__0 It seems like not a good behaviour.
__label__0 If I want to update a Live Tile from my own App I can't draw it's background image on the phone, because if I store it to IsolatedStorage i'm not able to get an URI for it which I could provide the StandardTileData-Object with.
__label__1 So please add TCP timestamps option support to the StreamSocketControl class.
__label__0 I've reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.
__label__1 Also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue.
__label__0 When you could connect your feedly to your wordpress.com account, why shouldn't you be able to subscribe to them?
__label__1 Add MSAL support for v2 auth model.
__label__0 I'm currently using a controller mapper like Xpadder and JoyXoff with my Xbox 360 controller.
__label__0 bizview rating is about 4.5 and has many reviews.
__label__0 Hi, I am developing an app that play remote MP4 file via Internet using MediaElement.
__label__0 More apps sold = more cloud processing and cloud data storage = more revenue.
__label__1 I wish we would have a button to hold payouts if we reach even the threshold because i have a problem i would like to hold payouts for months where i don____t earn so much because the transaction fee is 30$ to my country and the payout threshold is 25$ so if i earn let____s say 30$ i get 0$ because of the transaction fees.
__label__1 Solution: when open by a file type association the at least a simple dialog should ask: Allow access to all those file-types or to the folder or only that file.
__label__0 Import alert tones
__label__0 System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: The system cannot find the path specified.
__label__1 I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool(option in emulator) with which we can take screenshots once, in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app.
__label__0 The low-end phone with less storage but with the SD are really diffused, but the limit of the data that can't be stored in SD is awful.
__label__0 This is possible on Android and iOS.
__label__0  I understand the limitations of Apple so it's unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows 10 PC.
__label__0 I have a bar-code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port.
__label__0 A lot of people are moving to F# PCLs for library code and to be able to use those PCLs in the UWP and get native compilation via .
__label__0 Make DataTemplate behave like Xamarin.Forms DataTemplate class where you have 3 constructors:
__label__1 Download.GetPercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating ProgessBar
__label__0 If not, what is the recommended solution.
__label__0 Unless your app makes it into the Top Apps sections or Promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves.
__label__1 If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.
__label__0 In order to reproduce it, one should just try to record an audio on the___ more

__label__0 The only possibility to search them is to use UDP Broadcast.
__label__0 Easy when you dont have lots of contacts, but when you are managing Thousands of contacts, it makes life easy.
__label__1 I strongly think that more background color's should be there, like instead of just black and white, have blue, red, green and stuff like that and more accent colors 3.
__label__1 Give Some API to find out these thing.Android and IPhone provide API's to find out these thing.And don't give accuses because of security reasons.Android and IPhone is also secure.So work on it and Provide Some API because in Mobile technology it is very difficult to create application without this.
__label__1 I would greatly apperciate if these APIs could be added to UWP.
__label__0 Benefits: gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like.
__label__1 Maybe you need to contact TeslaCoil Software for information on how to implement that.
__label__0 If you take___ more
__label__0 There is no default property or method of ListBox control which will give us the currently binded items on view or carousel control for WP7
__label__1 An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list, and select which ones are displayed.

__label__1 The Bluetooth Smart version 4.2 specifications were officially adopted in December 2014 (ttps://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/adopted-specifications) however according this document ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn133849(v=vs.85).

__label__0 This is bad for signal analysis scenario.
__label__0 This make it easy to implement and obtain rating.Saves time and can focus on app logic as opposed to mundane tasks.
__label__0 This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying (or not enjoying) the app.
__label__0 This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.
__label__0 There is a very annoying bug in the Windows 10 Store that hides apps form listing.

__label__0 Currently I can assign a license to all members of a group but it isn't kept up to date.
__label__0 When a developer opened a developer account, Microsoft doesn't issue business invoice for registration fee.
__label__0 For instance the following dev accounts have the same apps spammed under multiple accounts: Maajio Dev Box Team Dopeware Labs Yemba Dev Wamba Dev All of the above accounts are the same developer.
__label__1 Please do the same for Windows Phone Store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users___ more

__label__0 Hi Microsoft, I would like to report a bug certain HTML code that causes the Inbox to crash instantly upon viewing the email.
__label__1 Many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make Feedly a pure-web-based app.	
__label__0 For example, logging GPS position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for 2sec every 30sec with another background task running every 30min for perhaps 30sec to send the batched data to a webservice.
__label__1 remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen where you can see everything that happened until interacted with on the phone by simply pressing the lock button on this screen and the logo of the application of the Communication provides a small preview of a soft black and white and also allow us to access it only touched his notice.
__label__0 When it's stuck (*BUSY*) you sometimes can't stop it for several minutes.
__label__1 Recognition is very accurate, it should be easy to add two buttons for this.
__label__1 Having access to the Visibility of the System Back button is good but there are some scenario's where I think it would make sense to have a Disabled state for this button which could be toggled by Dev's in certain scenarios.
__label__1 It would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the App-object in the App.xaml-file and to make this the ultimate root.
__label__0 We need to share all our data from our mobile phone or SD card, so we need a file manager on WP...
__label__0 This capability would not only enhance the submission experience, but it would also allow for Store submissions to be added and tracked in the developer's source control system (e.g., TFS, git).
__label__0 Having to RE enter things like version number, application name, etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes.
__label__0 I find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and it's never vey good.
__label__1 Hi, Please add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.
__label__0 The screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment.
__label__0 I'm developing an app containing data that a user might want to keep in view for a while, without worrying about accidentally pressing any of the hardware buttons, thereby exiting the current view.
__label__0 I hope you understand me.
__label__0 In the requirement page, I could see Windows 8 64 bit is required to run WP SDK8.0.
__label__1 It would be very useful for some audio applications to turn the speaker on while headset is connected.
__label__1 Please add api's for sharing to reading list.
__label__0 Integration with Net News Wire, so we can keep updated on every Mac (I use NNW for publishing to my blog with MarsEdit); 
__label__0 It's some___ more
__label__0 When HeightLine != -1 then the height is calculated using HeightLine Property.
__label__0 Partiendo de nada conectar con el todo!!
__label__1 BatteryManager should provide mechanism to tell us whether phone is plugged in AC or using USB.
__label__0 This property is especially usefull when AdaptItemHeight is set to true.
__label__0 Most probably the problem is in these two lines:
__label__0 I later found that the original submission had also been successful, even though it had hung, so that there were now two duplicate submissions in Processing Certification with slightly different aliases.
__label__0 There is a market for this type of application, allowing a 3rd party to develop it would: 1.
__label__0 x:Bind is great and I love it.
__label__0 I have already selected the appropriate category for you leave this feedback.
__label__0 In the .NET Full Framework, we would use a .config file to make Assembly Binding Redirection (normally, we would point all versions of A to its most recent version), but this is not possible right now in Windows Phone... :( As far as I can now, this affects the whole Silverlight Framework, not just Windows Phone... We really need Assembly Binding Redirection (or Publisher Policies) is Windows Phone!!
__label__0 This seems to be a serious security flaw with the API if it is allowing blank passwords to proceed as valid (while wrong passwords are treated as invalid).
__label__1 Allow the WebView to display URI from the application's local folder.
__label__1 I'd like to record an audio/video file while playing a audio file in the background.
__label__0 Right now, I can have several Google apps open in separate tabs in Thunderbird.
__label__0 Right now I have to manage this myself.
__label__1 With the fazing out of Google Reader, it would be great if Feedly could take its place in my third tab.
__label__0 I had to re-open video and change the Position property again and sometimes this problem is disappeared.
__label__1 Now that Microsoft has bought Xamarin integrated it in Visual Studio and made it free it would be awesome to replace Xamarin.Forms Xaml syntax with current UWP so that Devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as RelativePanel x:Bind Adaptive Triggers Live Visual Tree etc and also no learning curve for Xamarin.Forms-specific naming conventions (e.g StackLayout instead of StackPanel)
__label__0 Why doesn't WP create albums?
__label__0 I hope you will think about it and take a decision in my favor.
__label__0 The Street and StreetNumber property of the MapLocationFinder.FindLocationsAsync() results have no value.
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files,___ more
__label__0 I'm using the OnlineIdAuthenticator instead of the LiveSDK because it's API references that I would be able to always show a UI to prompt the user to enter their credentials by setting the CredentialPromptType to RetypeCredentials.

However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on Save, which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned.
__label__0 This change would encourage consistency with both the apps built-in to the OS and within an app itself.
__label__0 The android emulator can it.
__label__0 Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly, but not worldwide, and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.
__label__0 as it occurs on Android and iOS.
__label__0 http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/613932/windows-phone-7-visual-studio-generates-uncompilable-code-when-adding-an-image-to-a-resource-file
__label__0 I don't like comparisons, however all the Windows 10 UWP effort is another attempt to get users into the Windows platform right?
__label__0 Let's say I have a couple of views and their related viewmodels.
__label__0 The Windows Dev Center does not allow that.
__label__0 If necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors - at least at school so the can learn how great Software has to feel and look like.
__label__1 Please provide consistency throughout the entire Microsoft development ecosystem!
__label__0 I often have many short videos which I have to click individually which is pretty annoying when I want to do sth else and not touch computer.
__label__1 It would be great if MediaControl supported webm format!
__label__0 And rebind of the serach button.
__label__0 And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM)
__label__1 It would be nice if we could get the Tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later.
__label__0 Please feel free to contact me directly regarding this.
__label__0 Microsoft is not solving this issue.
__label__0 The MapCamera returned by MapControl.ActualCamera has an altitude of 10000 even if it is actually greater than 10000 meters.
__label__1 I want that feature back as I would like to mail my articles directly.
__label__1 Feedly should let users login through Mozilla Persona or Gravatar, which don't track users.
__label__0 Please with any humanity in you!
__label__0 .
__label__0 If the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter.
__label__1 I think it's good if RotatorTile has an indicator which shows what index is selected or maybe another control that can be attached to RotatorTile.
__label__1 This behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the SDK to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format.
__label__0 Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....
__label__0 The Online Media extensibility is fantastic, however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums, pictures and videos.
__label__0 When I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box.
__label__0 The company for I works loose a project because one of the client's requirements is change the Windows Wallpaper, ringtones and other features that are no disponible in Windows Phone 7.
__label__1 Hi is it possible to add proceeds since last payment information in the windows phone dev center applications
__label__0 In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.
__label__0 From what I've found I need to use: SmsComposeTask MySMS = new SmsComposeTask(); MySMS.Body = theSMSTextCodeMsg; // some code to ask for information from the SMS service MySMS.To = theSMSServiceNumber; MySMS.Show(); And then the user have to confirm the SMS sending... (no way to send automaticly from the app?)
__label__0 Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants.
__label__1 There is no user interaction here, so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario.
__label__1 An app can at least have a button directly to call history so user can see call history (since a direct API for call-history is not given due to security reasons).
__label__0 Would work just like Apple does, there is no reason why we need to purchase a certificate every year from a root CA and worry about certificate chain issues.
__label__0 The majority of apps I see at the marketplace doesn't have any review's.
__label__0 Even the official Microsoft UWP sample accuses the same problem:
__label__0 As it is, it___ more
__label__0 No sample code yet available in SDK.
__label__0 I think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall.
__label__0 * Allow panning and zooming.
__label__0 I think its for open in browser or maybe share with chrome.
__label__0 So my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only SIM code?
__label__0 Note: 3d projection in WinRT is no solution.
__label__0 In the dashboard, when you are uploading images in the app description, it does not work for me as I'm 100% sure there's a timeout implemented in the uploading code.
__label__0 Platforms like iOS and Android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser.
__label__0 Need access to set this property programmatically.
__label__0 Keyboard remains NumericPin.
__label__0 Simply like in a Windows 8
__label__0 A new tile, who is be a folder.
__label__1 Maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved, and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved
__label__0 In contrast to += in C# the AddHandler statement in VB.NET does not create a handler method.
__label__1 Of course it would be even better to make xaml use TypeConverter additionally for compatibility's sake with WPF.
__label__1 Please provide access to Calendar API to customize the day styles basing upon requirement
__label__0 The share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if it's a small icon.
__label__0 If this is something that you would like to look into, please contact DreamSpark as well.
__label__0 I keep reading that that's possible, but can't find any setting or even anyone explaining HOW it's done.
__label__0 That would be sort of like going to Starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for Cream in your Coffee... where the cream layer is for your Headers....
__label__1 It would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one.
__label__0 There are more and more external sensors, not only medical, but all kind of proximity stuff for watches, smart apliances, cars, and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps.
__label__0 ability to make simple applications on the phone and then publish them to the marketplace would be appreciated.
__label__0 Thanks and keep up the good work with Windows Phone!
__label__0 However this feature is not present in the Store app on the Xbox.
__label__0 I see people talking about the extension all over the place - but for the life of me, I cannot locate a link to the damn thing.
__label__0 System supported application error reporting service, that would report back to developers application crashes and details.
__label__0 This control makes a great addition for displaying large amounts of data in a visual friendly format.
__label__1 Can Microsoft take Advertising support seriously, and provide world wide Ad promotion and delivery.
__label__1 Allow all your Saved for Later items to be exported as a bookmark file in a similar format to the Firefox and Google Chrome bookmarks export tool.
__label__0 Enabling developers to access a the data sent to the device screen for displaying.
__label__1 Could you add the link for the feedback hub to the store's app review form?
__label__0 Although it is possible to define custom ETW events, and to generate those events, the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events.
__label__0 Sometimes they're much more useful than data binding (for example, when I need a StaticResource as a property value).
__label__0 If we can see the current voltage level, we can determine if the phone is plugged in to USB power, or utilizing an induction charger.
__label__0 The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access.
__label__0 How to emulate the bug
__label__0 we will be happy.
__label__1 It would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with GDI+ and the Layered Windows API
__label__0 But i found a solution.
__label__0 The previous 5 app are: - old - not updated - with less reviews - low rating How bizview can not be first in all regions?
__label__0 sandboxed UWP applications anyway.
__label__0 Home automation is a huge market for Windows devices.

A big piece of this is being able to monitor/control IP Cameras such as the Foscam HD cameras.

Being able to discover, enumerate, and stream video from and audio to/from these devices as part of the UAP platform (instead of wonky solutions like ONVIF) would be awesome
__label__0 Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.
__label__0 It appears that garbage data (from the stack I assume) is being used for the value `curInlineLength`.
__label__0 But it should be common on all sense not just on general things, but also on UI XAML code!
__label__0 Other than our product manager said 500 pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact
__label__0 The new start menu features the Aero (transparency and blur) effects we all love.

__label__0 One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!
__label__0 Purpose: Events related to: When one phone call starts and ends.
__label__0 There are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack.
__label__1 Allow downloading of submissioned .xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process.
__label__0 It will allow code anywhere anytime on windows idea.
__label__0 From these, I concluded that a big part of 3D rendering might be a burden upon CPU, while GPU does not do much.
__label__0 As a developer I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
__label__0 I want to create a app for incoming call recording but WP not provide any API for do this.
__label__1 The RSS markup of these feeds identifies the author (e.g. dc:creator), use that to set the author attribute for the Evernote note?
__label__1 It would be more useful to be able to sort by Reviews Acquisitions Crashes and Ratings.
__label__1 The xaml engine of UWP should manage complex types for xaml attributes
__label__0 So they get stuck in all the networks' devices' cache and never go away.
__label__1 Provide more help with understand text that coming from cortanan.
__label__0 There is lack of support for digitally signing X509 client certificates.
__label__0 Cons: 1.
__label__0 Ideally these classes would be extended to accept a UserControl object that would be shown instead of the standard Title.
__label__0 This is one of the important feature required in Windows Phone dev report.
__label__0 Hello Sir/Ma'am.
__label__0 Getting version and changelog info in Microsoft Store on WIndows 10 is way to hard.
__label__0 So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.
__label__1 Make a new setting that allows users to optin to this functionality.
__label__0 The Backgroundtasks can currently be launched every 15 minutes by the TimeTrigger.
__label__1 Optionally the worker side of async / awaitable should accept notification URI in conjunction with Type which ( the Type itself ) may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical HTTP message... the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource.
__label__1 Seeing as SplitView is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area it would make sense for SplitView to allow a PanePlacement.Top and PanePlacement.Bottom in addition to its current Left and Right parameters.
__label__0 From there, everything is taken care of for me.
__label__0 You know many of Microsoft Apps are updated with new SDK and it'll be available at the store during Insider Preview.
__label__1 atleast provide the URI to launch native equalizer from phone's setting.
__label__0 Thank you!
__label__0 Take a look at the jQuery Mobile demo http://jquerymobile.com/test on your WP7 to see what I mean.
__label__0 I get to play music etc with by bluetooth headset.
__label__0 The site is faster in Chrome and IE but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance.
__label__0 One simple example where the WrapPanel is essential is when displaying a ______tag cloud__.
__label__0 And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another.
__label__1 Some kind of handlers on context menus of certain objects would be great.
__label__0 Future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead.
__label__0 Footnote popovers, as used on many popular blogs and Wikipedia, display the footnote itself within a pop-up bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to.
__label__0 I understand this is an Asus and Microsoft concern and hope this evaluation helps in the next update.
__label__0 Setting ProtextedText to On doesn't work the selected text is still modifiable.
__label__0 If we use Application.ExecutablePath when the user open the Shortcut he gets an access permission error so I'm trying to create it using shell:AppsFolder\ but I can't get the AppUserModelId
__label__0 Google Reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category/label used.
__label__1 If you add files from across the filesytem which I do in my app... letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the 1000 files limit.
__label__1 If FM radio APIs are brought in it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well.
__label__1 Could you please add SelectRanges(IEnumerabel<ItemIndexRange> itemIndexRanges) to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make SelectedRanges property is only { get; set; } to be able to replace existing selection ranges
__label__1 If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.
__label__0 First of all, on Windows Phone 8.1 I always get an IOException when trying to call PickContactAsync().
__label__0 artist image ....
__label__1 I think we need Completed event and something like SmsResult that can be used.
__label__0 Keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware.
__label__0 I know of many folks -- including yours truly -- who use Feedly in conjunction with Pocket.
__label__0 It is not at all flexible.
__label__0 We should have the choice!
__label__0 When i call those codes, i get answer after 2 minutes and i don't have an option to reply with my choise.
__label__0 Use 3rd party managed 3d graphics library which is a wrapper around DirectX.
__label__0 2
__label__1 Add ability to share whole articles to Evernote.
__label__1 Make It possible to choose different sounds for different apps.
__label__1 We want it to be between Feedly and us only, especially now that the government is working to get open access to our Google accounts.
__label__0 The Targeted Distribution approach doesn't seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients.
__label__0 - .
__label__0 We frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc.
__label__0 The call history is missing the following menus.
__label__0 Working on this request at the earliest would be really appreciated.
__label__0 It does not make a sense when the large (multimedia) files have to be transferred (You first have to transfer them up to Skydrive and then - download to phone).
__label__0 This is in fact documented and the offical recommendation is to try/catch closer to the code (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.application.unhandledexception).
__label__1 I think Microsoft should add a new property to FontIcon that combines FontFamily and Glyph into a single Uri Property call it GlyphUri.
__label__0 You can also find a code sample here
__label__0 I don't want to use a File Picker or XAML.
__label__0 I have previously used the desktop NCryptCreatePersistedKey with NCRYPT_ECDH_P256_ALGORITHM followed by
__label__0 But we can't change the size of the window that is opened.
__label__0 I've had to switch back to Feedly just so I can subscribe to new feeds!!!
__label__1 You should be able to start an app like the flashlight app directly from the notification center.
__label__0 For instance, i click a hyperlinked phone number and i am given the option to call with the phone, or skype.
__label__0 The Windows Store analytics API is great.
__label__0 Once it happens in normal usage, you won't be able to reinitialize the player at all without restarting the phone.
__label__0 Other little bugs: with my lumia 820 before first WP8 upgrade work fine with vocal commands but from first upgrade to now is bad.
__label__0 It's so annoying!!
__label__1 I use RockMelt as browser and feedly won't load, he loads just fine in google chrome, but I would like to be able to use it with RockMel
__label__0 La mayor__a de las aplicaciones est__n en ingles, muchas limitan sus capacidades.
__label__0 You used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it.
__label__1 Currently you have to provide a Splash Screen to get your app to pass the certification kit, which should really be a developer's choice like before.

__label__0 Feedly mini is very nice plug-in for me.
__label__1 The GZipStream class should be available for Windows Phone developers, so we don't have to rely on 3rd party libraries to compress and decompress streams.
__label__0 But that would be beyond what the control *should* do in terms of separation of concerns.
__label__0 I assume the tool is at most 1 meg.
__label__1 A control similar to the FlowDocumentReader/ FlowDocumentScrollViewer would be really awesome!
__label__0 Windows 8 phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the calculator app.
__label__1 Include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers.
__label__0 I cannot pick the number from unanswered calls or somewhere else, because those numbers are not stored in my phone.
__label__0 Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support.
__label__0 The idea of background agents expiring if they have not been 're-initialized' in two weeks makes sense.
__label__1 That could be automatic too.
__label__0  - CalendarView supports arrows that appear when hovered allowing mouse users to switch months
__label__1 This UI should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows10 task-bar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications.
__label__1 3) The aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote API as a work around.
__label__0 So I uninstalled KB4057144 became build 15063.850.
__label__0 The problem starts after a certain app update.
__label__1 Create a SubClass of Panel that allows AbsolutePositioning of it's children, yet honours the layout bounds imposed by it's own parent, unlike Canvas which is unlimited in Size and must be clipped to stop the overflow of any children
__label__0 I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.
__label__0 Open the damn thing up.
__label__1 Please allow to set the display language of MapControl to one different from Windows display language.
__label__0 There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.
__label__0 This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.
__label__0 These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.
__label__0 Not everybody wants a toy and moving tiles around by touch.

Some want a tool that satisfies their need, not create problems.
__label__0 All uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call, so it's very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer, it's good that the user can choose the better method to search, like name or/and surname or/and Address etc...
__label__1 Ads should start displaying in an app on the day it is published so the developer can generate revenue immediately.
__label__0 We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK.
__label__0 As a long time WP7/8 and now W10M user I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse.

__label__0 Currently the ScrollViewer's content can be overpanned.

__label__1 Add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation.
__label__0 I often fiddle with the price of the In-App Purchase(IAP) in my WP app, to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and #of purchases.
__label__0 We can open a pdf in webview by html file.But we cannot open pdf file from a url with .dpf extension.
__label__1 Add FeedReader____ to the App Center list____.
__label__0 The SD Card support in WP8 is practically useless because built-in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as 'reserved file and URI associations'.
__label__1 Please add an overload to create a MediaStreamSample from a D3D Surface.
__label__0 So with that, I really do appreciate the fact the Marketplace and developer API's allow for demo mode, and I sincerely hope___ more

__label__0 instead of non-english characters.

__label__0 Today we're using WPF for these tasks.
__label__1 Would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running?
__label__0 If I_____ more

__label__0 The current design documentation at ______https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn958439.aspx provides only files in Powerpoint and Adobe Illustrator formats.

My company and thousands of others use Sketch to develop app interfaces, that we then give to our developers.
__label__1 IMDb should open to the Star Wars page directly from bing's search results.
__label__0 There are several developers using dishonest methods to boost their apps, including fake ratings.
__label__0 Providing an overlay between the image and the text is a horrible workaround that causes you to lose part of the image.
__label__0 The solution is open-sourcing WinDbg and related tools (dbghlp, WinDbg extensions, etc.), which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at Microsoft doesn't manage to.
__label__0 I can't delete or hide them in the dashboard.
__label__1 There should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the New LOB apps section under manage apps.
__label__0 When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn't exist.
__label__0 I hope it's right.
__label__0 We have an app that at times adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl.
__label__0 Java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets don't work.
__label__1 Please arabic keyboard not found in lumia 610 please support an arabic
__label__0 This also applies to icons.

__label__0 I would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for Windows Phone if Microsoft___ more
__label__0 SMIL is the best declarative language for animations in the world, there is nothing like it.

__label__0 When submitting (fixing the Age Ratings) Age Ratings the dev center will not let me submit more than 4 or 5 in a row.
__label__0 Like, your Facebook News Feed could be a feed on Feedly.
__label__0 Link : https://github.com/MishaUliutin/MuPDF.WinRT Please provide a way to render Pdf and display it in PDF viewer control.
__label__0 That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language.
__label__1 If Microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a PC then just turn off games.
__label__0 I want my user to stay inside my app.
__label__0 Apparently I need to download 6 gigs worth of SDK just to get that one file.
__label__0 I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit.
__label__0 Thanks in advance.
__label__1 Please make an option like windows phone 8 to mark several messages at the time of deletion... As tapping and holding of every message and deleting take more time and it makes angry ....
__label__1 The panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the API from inside our Apps it would be great.
__label__0 example.
__label__0 Some excellent tools to help find good cellular service, like GSM Monitor, are not currently supported due to lack of an api to support the raw cellular data in real time.
__label__0 I have seen a open source but it didn't work either .
__label__0 It’s also not wrapping the headers.
__label__0 Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.
__label__0 Thanks I know you can do it if you really try ;)
__label__1 Allow to pin things to pinterest
__label__0 Some of them allows user to store Favorites.
__label__0 Remove the limitations which inhibits WinRT *custom* components to be used on a desktop application.
__label__0 And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.
__label__0 I don't want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday...I've to wait til Monday?
__label__0 I tried to play the same remote video via WIFI and iPhone 4 always win Nokia Lumia 920.
__label__0 Right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom.
__label__0 I haven't found any possible way to do that so I assume it doesn't exist currently.
__label__0 It's supremely annoying while developing to have to go through the certification wait time just to add an in-app purchase product to the dev center.
__label__0 I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze.
__label__0 What do you think?
__label__0 Currently UC browser allows us to upload pictures only and so does number of messaging apps.
__label__0 I've tried adding it manually but it doesn't work, and in any case it shouldn't be that awkward.
__label__0 As a developer I'm always in the Dev Dashboard.
__label__0 However there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in ResourceDictionary files or embedded directly into the page XAML.
__label__0 I don't understand why if I search with the simple term as planner it does not show up.
__label__0 add read later to the desktop extensions.
__label__1 I would love to be able to save directly to Pocket like I can on the android app.
__label__0 Currently MS only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries (way to go in leading the way with technology in business!!)
__label__0 See attached.
__label__1 Bit.ly's bookmark function, combined with it's URL shortener and usage information would be really useful when sharing from feedly!
__label__0 Kinda like UserVoice but for bug reports?
__label__0 When it's stuck (*BUSY*) you sometimes can't stop it for several minutes.
__label__0 If so, what happens to existing Windows Phone 7 apps that run on a Windows Phone 8 device?
__label__0 I know retirement is a keyword and is also in our description but if I search with retirement our app does not show up.
__label__0 OpenXML SDK Office for WinRT __ Office Primary Interop Assembly Classes for WinRT
__label__0 Add opacity per layer to dynamically adjust layer opacity (say with a slider) if tiles have been previously loaded and viewed.
__label__1 Further thoughts: feedly could develop 'subscription options' for content creators.
__label__0 My idea is that You are using tour own agenda and then notice the poor synchronising performance of it with Google agenda.
__label__0 But it is not just for tag clouds.
__label__1 Add right to left orientation for text and pages support in windows phone studio app website.
__label__0 I find that I want the batterysaver on most of the time, or my phone barely lasts a day without being plugged in.
__label__0 I've tried this sample but not a luck.
__label__0 It is especially wierd since they can sync pictures and music.
__label__0 For an app that doesn't require a login, so there's no account to tie the usage to, and doesn't have a natural way to limit functionality, adding a trial-mode feels like implement-and-pray.
__label__0 Now when you reset your phone or move to a new phone the linking is not kept.
__label__1 But IE9 would be nice to support.
__label__1 Is it possible to add the note to the review form as following?
__label__0 Please let me know if you would like to use this as the code itself is ready to go and easy to use.
__label__1 I would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device.
__label__0 I'm not able to associate the application with the phone build in the store(because the app name is not reserved to this, there is no package name or package id for this in the store) How can I resolve_____ more
__label__0 My game is controlled by the Accelerometer and has very rapid gameplay that makes switching from using the Accelerometer to Screenshot tab and actually capturing a screenshot impossible.
__label__0 I know this will be simple just edit the style but I can't make it right
__label__1 I would like the ability to pass the photo from my app to an app (of the user's choice via an app picker) that supports the selected photo type.
__label__1 And please force adobe to update their pdf viewer, its terrible :'( Word displays documents terribly.
__label__0 Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search.
__label__0 There are design toolkits available for several designer programs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/downloads/index.
__label__1 We need a beta store for windows 10 apps for selected internal testers only.
__label__0 Currently it is really painful to add new Controls from newer Windows SDK versions to apps and still support older versions.
__label__0 The Modern compiler produces a header-only library designed to provide Standard C++ developers with first-class access to the Windows API.
__label__0 The more complex an API feature the less likely there'll be useful documentation on how to use it or how it behaves.
__label__0 It doesn't matter if I set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone; the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to Cortana is quite noticeable.
__label__1 Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username/password authentication on the binding.
__label__0 I already tried renaming svhost.exe with no luck.
__label__0 Even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button.
__label__0 That would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app.
__label__0 Don't you have any concern for thousands of ISVs who developed Windows utility programs in the past to make Windows popular and successful?
__label__0 However collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree.
__label__0 You've forgotten to change that icon
__label__1 Get public tweets without user's authentication
__label__1 A better option would be to add a new ROLE option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues.
__label__1 It would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile, except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to Pocket or an alternative read-it-later app, Pocket all or something like that.
__label__1 It would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add-ons in Developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add-on again and again.
__label__0 register as a launcher/chooser] to ease on-device inter-application communication
__label__0 It either does not play the short sound effect or plays it seconds too late.
__label__1 When notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default.
__label__0 It doesn't have to be full access.
__label__0 I feel like why to add built-in drawing functionality at all as 3d is not built-in.
__label__0 It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.
__label__0 There is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup.
__label__1 Please add a semi-automated test queue mode to Driver Verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have Driver Verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot.
__label__1 Use file playback sample or custom effects sample.
__label__0 It uses C++11____s move semantics to handle reference counting reliably and sparingly.
__label__0 This is unfair to devs and cheapens the Windows Store experience.
__label__0 WinDbg is a fundamental and very important tool in developing for Windows.
__label__1 Please allow generic classes to be base classes of XAML pages/controls.
__label__0 We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard (typically aids in drawing and ink based applications)
__label__0 Menu icons In a variety of menu entries add icons, they can not read the text to understand intent.System Menu(pin to start screen),ApplicationBar.
__label__1 Providing thos apps would boost UWp as platform and thus create more possibilities for Users and Developers together.
__label__0 Buffer overrun while writing to 'm_pSACL': the writable size is 'pSACL->AclSize' bytes but '8' bytes might be written.
__label__0 It is extremely poor invoice, no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementary_____ more
__label__0 The ComboBox now automatically has the infinite scrolling behavior when lots of items are present.
__label__0 If I download that track and play it in standard player there is no such a glitch.
__label__1 I think you should provide the option to capture audio with an external mic via the 3.5mm jack(and not through a bluethooth external mic).
__label__0 The values from GPS-accuracy are top.
__label__0 Some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction?
__label__0 in which it will pick up the address from the map and gets the turn by turn voice direction and it works like a charm.
__label__1 Add an option for remove the image in a contact.
__label__0 My phone (Lumia 925) has WP8.1 with all updates.
__label__0 Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities.
__label__0 WinDbg is a fundamental and very important tool in developing for Windows.

Unfortunately, it is also bug-infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in 2015.
__label__1 If they want to compete with Android and iPhone, a good direction navigation system app is must on windows phone.
__label__0 If a contact has a phone number whose type is company, then you have no way to access it in a 3rd-party app, because the Contact.PhoneNumbers does not contain it.
__label__0 And if Microsoft couldn't translate it, it could just copy over the original text.
__label__0 At present I have to manually record when I change the price, as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal, which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported Excel file.
__label__0 Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.
__label__0 Nokia Lumia 820 | windows 8.1
__label__0 The test.log file is created again.
__label__0 Both show we a Google login in a web view within their apps.
__label__0 Because WVGA and WXGA are the same aspect ratio, and because the website is a giant PITA in uploading images, you have to take and submit 3 screenshots per actual screenshot per language.
__label__0 Currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real-time as and when it happens.
__label__1 So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP.
__label__0 And I created this thread on the MSDN forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/af38910b-e097-484a-a76a-94fb7880da6b/uwpwinjslistview-items-cannot-be-invoked-after-scrolling-the-listview-with-the-touchscreen?forum=wpdevelop

__label__1 Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge too ?
__label__0 Every phone u use except windows, we write a name on dial pad , contact list has shown.
__label__0 A big downside hides in DragDrop (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/drag-and-drop)
__label__0 This panel is similar to a StackPanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down.
__label__1 There should be a way of registering for this, without paying, only for publishment you have to pay.
__label__0 Please let me know is it possible to do.
__label__0 I tried more than 5 on my Nook Simple Touch.
__label__1 Instead of making a new todo list app, let me extend the native one.
__label__0 The WPF Grid control had a ShowGridLines property.
__label__0 Let the user decide if an app should have access to calendar files.
__label__0 Ie Littlewoods etc item images
__label__0 When I tried to use it to text someone, the OS keeps on crashing and restarting.
__label__0 I add RSS source by click the RSS icon on the URL bar on Chrome, but with feedly i can't do it.	
__label__0 Set up a brokerage system, whereby the developer never sees the users live email address, and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user.
__label__0 So if an app does contacts then another app could query the contact data instead of providing it's own mechanism for contacts.
__label__0 Some wanna use fully unlocked Windows Phone 7 for fun.
__label__0 Closes alone than nothing
__label__1 Add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints (and support in Blend)
__label__0 The build in WP8 LongListSelector will jump to the last item added, when data loading.
__label__0 This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/commercial/incidents/117111417156306) and a Connect bug (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/feedback/details/3142497/build-16299-15-hyper-v-default-switch-nat-name-resolution-not-working).
__label__0 Is that in the upcoming roadmap?
__label__0 Is Connect sufficient?
__label__0 It's only currently possible via the web browser.
__label__0 Since i'ts my work computer I can't control the software upgrade.
__label__1 Allow us to use runtime arguments for Windows.ApplicationModel.FullTrustProcessLauncher.LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync() in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest
__label__0  I'm not the only one that has asked for this, but comments are lost on closed general IE threads now that Feedly works in IE 10.
__label__0 does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?
__label__0 Even the best-optimized app (Jeff Wilcox' 4th & mayor app comes to mind) is slow to start, compared with the included apps (like calendar or hubs).
__label__0 When adding a StatusFilter for Available Xbox is never shown.
__label__0 Yes, I know that the first build of Mac OS 10.9 (13A376u) is as slow as a tortoise.
__label__1 Please put this project on high priority so that classic apps can get on to the store.
__label__1 Allowing UWP access packaged COM will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow re-use much more traditional win32 apps.
__label__0 PowerShell Error Record:

__label__0 In my old Android calendar is it no problem but in my wp8 is it not possible.
__label__0 Also the 'more from' publisher was an easy way for the developer to promote one's other published apps.
__label__1 I think Microsoft needs OR boost XAML development OR if it doesn't interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it...
__label__0 It's better if we wake up early.
__label__0 What we can offer you is the attempt to transfer your apps to the new account.
__label__0 NET.
__label__0 Seems kind of pointless for those who don't have a Buffer account (nor want one) to have to create an account, and have it be the middleman between Feedly and Facebook.
__label__0 public static readonly DependencyProperty IsTestProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(nameof(IsTest)typeof(bool?
__label__0 Currently it's not possoble to make connections behind proxy servers that require authentication.
__label__0 The current WebAPIs are too limited for developers to create a new browser.
__label__1 Allow for default settings so that when this new defaulting mode is enabled, clicking the Evernote icon will save with no additional interaction.
__label__1 There are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult, but I feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea, both for developers and for Microsoft.
__label__1 Add xap support for some apps like explorer and opera
__label__0 : there is another post that I voted because I can't change the country in my account.
__label__0 I would like to register a url with my application so that when someone clicks http://www.mydomain.com/ in the browser or is redirected to the browser from another application they are given the option to open my application instead of the browser.
__label__0 Problems I have encountered: 1) While using PositionChanged event Geolocator.ReportInterval seems to be ignored.
__label__0 I ask via chat they give me illogical answer like your app its not on market and its not searchable but only deeplink work !

__label__0 And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.
__label__1 We need backward compatibility for XAML just like Android for example we can just use NavigationView without any conditional check at all.
__label__1 Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less___ more
__label__0 Currently, it is not possible for us to release this feature___ more
__label__0  - CalendarView supports mouse scroll to switch months
__label__0 2) Launch the application.
__label__0 It happened before the 2nd big wp8.1 update too.
__label__0 Exchange rate between US$ and ___ is too low.
__label__0 SMIL is the lingua franca of vector animation.
__label__0 I'm intalling: Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Tools 7.1 (Beta) - ENU Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate - ENU Service Pack 1.
__label__1 Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username/password authentication on the binding.
__label__1 Please come back with previous solution.
__label__1 It would be better if it was as fast as the WebClient class used in a desktop application
__label__0 PS: I cannot try to create the folders in advance because each time the converter generates and uses a new GUID.
__label__0 From there the application could be fully launched if desired.
__label__0 This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.
__label__0 Please fix that anoying issue.
__label__0 PLEASE!!!!!!!
__label__0 If the user did not have an account configured for that provider, they could be given the chance to create one (or simply redirected to the social network providers website).
__label__0 No app-driven solution.
__label__0 A WPF-only solution is enough for me however.
__label__1 Would love to have a direct link to do this.
__label__0 I prefer using the reeder on my desktop than Feedly on the browser, since it opens links on the app, helping me focus on my reading.
__label__0 In Silverlight, it's maintained merely with different Urls.
__label__0 Currently we have to download and configure the silverlight toolkit to get certain UI elements that should really be integrated with the platform.
__label__0 I use IMFSourceReader on UWP and noticed following bug with FLAC decoding: it will not change position if SetCurrentPosition will be called right after initialization.
__label__0 - Sometimes when I seek the video by changing Position property, I've got a___ more
__label__0 If the user uninstalls and installs again later, the developer has no idea.
__label__0 Goals of the week, of the favourites teams.
__label__0 The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.
__label__0 I am as a developer feel lacking big power and think keeping up with WPF hoping it will get 3d graphics support.
__label__1 Don't let the wonderful Windows 10 UAP be a downgrade on features.
__label__0 According to documentation it is only possible using NFC (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj206987(v=vs.105).aspx#BKMK_URIassociations)
__label__0 We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.
__label__1 I want to have access to all single bytes within picture, so I can do with those bytes whatever I want.
__label__0 Possible solution: Route class implements IRoutePath.
__label__0 However when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 No such interface supported”.
__label__0 System is deleting and recreating the TLS self-signed certificates for the device portal on port 50443 a lot.. sometimes every 5-10 minutes in the windows log.
__label__0 I'm not able to associate the application with the phone build in the store(because the app name is not reserved to this, there is no package name or package id for this in the store) How can I resolve this issue without changing the name of the Phone Build.
__label__1 I can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked, but at least, give me a possibility to unlock the screen.
__label__0 Consider also option where you have application in several languages.
__label__0 Easily reproduced by just changing the apps.normal to apps.games.
__label__0 Bonus: You can't delete this feedback.
__label__0 Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing be working?
__label__1 I think the new dev center is a great step.

What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app.

That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language.

I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator.

I understand that having a translation is important but I am not a linguist (I honestly think I learned programming before proper grammar), I am a individual person making apps on my own and spending almost a whole day just to post the app descriptions is a big pain.
__label__1 (These options are available across the top bar of the window) I suggest adding an option to Create a Shortcut.
__label__0 Only allows numeric input
__label__0 Once again, these problems DO NOT happen on WP7.5 so I'd like to see if these are known issues on WP8 OS and hope to see the fix soon.
__label__1 I *think* IFTTT integration could get us there, with not too much in the way of additions, add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject, sender, body, etc., add 'mark as read' as an action
__label__0 Currently it only supports touch input.
__label__0 How UWP apps can compete with other systems with such things?
__label__0 In its simplest form the new Shortcut would open the application.
__label__0 This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receivers
__label__0 Take a look here https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp We need a better and lighter way to install only what's needed for the C/C++ compiler.
__label__1 Is there anything you can do to make Feedly work on IE 7?
__label__0 WP has all of the security from 8.1 and features and some nice features please let the last feature be the Android apps.
__label__0 You have to either manually press space between each word, or Swype each word twice.
__label__0 I have a bar-code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port.
__label__0 In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.
__label__0 Hello， I had verified the Desktop Bridge Email several days ago  but now I has no reach out other email， I try to submission my converted app to store  but get errors like that :
__label__0 when I press a link in an article that I'm reading on feedly then the link will always open inside Feedly.
__label__1 Allow a user to change the ring tone or sound of new txt messages coming to the phone.
__label__0 Furthermore, without any scientific proofs, I assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked, so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time?
__label__0 There's a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed.
__label__0 This is the same error that was marked Completed here:
__label__0 With mouse flyout opens on right click which is ok.
__label__0 As a developer I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.
__label__0 Regional Format does not automaticly mean the region i set the device to or the UI Langauge i chose.
__label__0 Hyper-V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability.
__label__0 Currently we need to do some trickery to take screenshots of application that use panorama control.
__label__1 Please unify the Windows Phone (8 / Blue / 9) and Windows (8 / 8.1 / 9) development compleatly!
__label__0 Is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses?
__label__0 Is this coming in a future release?
__label__0 The abillity to export an article or post directly to Kindle or/and other e-book readers.
__label__0 Being unable to set up our own set of contacts to test with is incredibly frustrating, especially as the test set doesn't even cover all scenarios (none have photos, for example).

__label__1 Provide a viewer for viewing office documents (e.g.
__label__0 Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how (or be told how) to do it, however it's not very intuitive and I'm concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be.
__label__0 But the polyline is shown OVER the street names.
__label__0 Because this is SSO for phone, the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly.
__label__1 I would really like to switch to UWP for development however I'm not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win32 apps wouldn't have any problem just downloading from a network drive.
__label__0 VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.
__label__0 You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.
__label__0 This meant that I ended up using PreferredLaunchViewSize during first launch and then Auto on subsequent launches.
__label__1 To fix it just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen and then maximize it again.
__label__0 When the email is not received (like in my case) the developer doesn't know the reason.
__label__0 You have stopped listing Classic Desktop Apps on the store.
__label__0 Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code:
__label__0 Recently I read about new WinPhone 8.1 features, and one of the which had took my attention, is the notification area.
__label__1 Import RSS from other readers
__label__1 User should be able to write style for all the ViewState like Focused Selected UnSelected Normal etc.
__label__0 And it is necessary for any app that needs to detect a custom word.
__label__0 When the user starts video playback on a phone we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar (on devices such as Lumia 950 that has them) and status bar.
__label__0 I'm looking to use ECDH key agreement in an universal windows app but I can't find a way to do so.
__label__0 It would save the user a lot of time and effort.
__label__0 But why was it working on my local machine?

__label__0 Currently the option to do so is not present.
__label__0 I want to turn it off.
__label__1 Having the means to inspect your app or site needs to be improved greatly.
__label__0 This makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not-so-relevant-anymore notifications in their action center.
__label__0 Unable to prevent auto close of InputPane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of InputPane in UWP with target version 16299 on Tablet.

aspx).

This is not possbile for UAP apps.

Another, even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an open with...-option in the built-in photos app.
__label__0 Providing the same scrolling in the Silverlight/WinRT textbox would definitely improve the user experience.
__label__1 I would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization.
__label__0 Is there any plan to support this protocol in WP?
__label__1 Moreover, it's better to have read-only API for phone call history, so developer can help to make better phone call related app like Android.
__label__1 It should work like a horizontal ListView or GridView...so you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge-like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old View/Page/List.
__label__0 The use case is that I'm surfing the web and I find a site that I'd like to follow.
__label__0 There are no keyword searches.
__label__0 I was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone.
__label__0 I just tell maps where I want to go and it will tell me what bus to take to get there.
__label__1 If Microsoft really wants to get into the IOT they should really support version 4.2 with IPv6 communication over Bluetooth
__label__0 Am even stock now  I would be glad if you can update it now.
__label__0 where the complex property is Begin and the complex value is 12 that represents a position {X=1 ; Y=2}.
__label__0 My problem related with Windows Phone Developer Account only.
__label__0 The window will be blank with only heading on it.
__label__0 I'm not sure what the deal is with Buffer but it seems like a needless step.
__label__0 That can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this (Google+ being the stupid other exception of the rule).
__label__0 Chrome would gradually get slower and slower (a new development since Feedly asked to run the always-on tray app).
__label__0 First,I want to download dll from webservice,So load assembly from stream
__label__0 This just helps make advertising easier, without listing individual apps.
__label__1 Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.
__label__0 Preparing Virtual File System
__label__0 Example code which registers a service using Windows' DNS-SD APIs:
__label__0 The sandbox nonsense has to go.
__label__0 To choose what test features is it right?
__label__1 for example, once you add a location to MapPolyLine Instance, that becomes a segment, I should then be able to control the look and feed such as Color of the stroke for that segment of the MapPolyLine.
__label__0 Somebody correct me if I'm way off base.
__label__0 A lot of programs provide navigation and GPS maps.
__label__0 If you have no more disk space; the install crashed.
__label__1 Default tags would also be helpful -- even better, configurable content keyword tagging would be great!
__label__1 Also HeightLines > 2 should automatically set AcceptsReturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multi-line textbox in XAML.
__label__1 We need something like an InstallationTask.
__label__0 Please do help me on this so that I can upload another new game in the store itself.
__label__1 Allow apps to download data like pocket for offline viewing.
__label__1 Please take a note of this.
__label__0 Bug is only in Edge web browser in input fields.
__label__0 Plz plz unlock it.

__label__0 The problem may be relevant to HTC HD7 only though, since I have no other device to test.
__label__0 I am doing Agile development on a business app and I need to let me boss test the app weekly.
__label__0 Examples include: - a (assemble) doesn't supporting 64-bit!
__label__0 when i__m on mobile data connection, i get all my notifications, when i__m on wifi there is no connection to the push server.
__label__0 It also provides an universal interchange format for animations.
__label__0 I completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness, but Windows Phone is currently too restrictive.
__label__0 Just depending on what the user decided accounts relate.
__label__1 Please don't add more and more features!
__label__0 I have a question related WACK.
__label__1 Please take this into consideration and make the ID public (maybe with a new capability requirement).
__label__0 Secondly, we have many versions_____ more
__label__0 Is it possible?
__label__0 It is showing the status 'generating' for the past 1 hour.
__label__0 Or for instance we are in a setup wizard we don't want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup.
__label__1 As the current time sync does not work correctly (at least in The Netherlands) i want the option to build my own.
__label__0 So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:
__label__0 I have the following entry: <Barcode> <Symbology>AZTEC</Symbology> <Value>M1STURM/ANDREAS EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C>5080 B2A N00 </Value> </Barcode> there you can see the > which is correct XML/HTML encoded version of >.
__label__1 I would propose adding the ability for the SplitView pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen.
__label__0 When I turn off the setting->screen autorotation,I find that this function is still enable in the setting->about phone.
__label__1 Apps need a way to work together.
__label__1 It would be more useful to be able to sort by Reviews Acquisitions Crashes and Ratings.
__label__0 artist image ....
__label__0 I know that storage and storing information is limited to the application context.
__label__0 I think Grid view of app list can ease access to app.app icons arrange such as photos in album, without name or any other description.
__label__0 StoreApp\AppStudio.Windows_1.0.0.0_AnyCPU.appx
__label__1 Is there anyway you could make Windbg Preview available for offline downloading?
__label__0 Br, Dejan Hi!
__label__1 But I hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful.
__label__0 x, we had a nice photo auto-upload capability that allowed an app creator to tie into the camera and automatically upload each pic that the user took.
__label__0 This Idea has already been posted for WinRT 5 years ago: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2831450-implicit-datatemplates-for-winrt

__label__0 This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.
__label__0 I've made a simple application all it did was just clear the backbuffer several times and presented the screen.
__label__0 Only video.
__label__0 This is a real problem.
__label__0 That way,_____ more
__label__0 The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.
__label__0 The following will reliably throw some flavor of interop exception:
__label__1 2) Make it possible to add the EnvironmentPermission node in the Package.appxmanifest to allow Environment variables to be retrieved.
__label__0 This is the third time in the past 6 months I have encountered this problem.
__label__0 Profiles like Office, Meeting, Outdoors or Night have proven useful and apps like Situations made them automatic.
__label__0 After releasing the pointer or finger the list abruptly return to position 0 and the refresh indicator is hidden
__label__0 There are workarounds, of course, like creating a timed background app that wakes up and looks at the camera roll for new stuff every so often, but that is a polling approach, which is always much less desirable and power efficient than an event-driven one.
__label__0 For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.
__label__0 There is a problem grabbing the edges/boarders of OS windows.
__label__0 Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly.
__label__1 Allow the messaging application to join in the default messaging application (Hub Message) for full interaction.
__label__1 Please make it possible to locate at the other three corners.

__label__0 I contacted support and they can't delete it either SRX1428283722ID
__label__0 great app!
__label__0 :) Hello Sir/Ma'am.
__label__0 I press 'connect', allow it, and it doesn't load the feeds, just returns to the same login page.
__label__0 I use Google Auth for both Pocket and for Feedly.
__label__0 The FileOpenPicker has the SuggestedStartLocation and the official description of how it works is:
__label__0 The same applies when you list all apps from the publisher/developer.
__label__0 Let's imagine that you drew a rectangle with yellow rounded corners and added the following text in it Login right after you've grouped it and now you want this to be a button simply you click convert to button and then click on toggle For XAML or click show XAML code and copy to clipboard then you just paste the code in Xamarin.Forms in Visual Studio.
__label__0 This change would allow Developer to be able to consider the usage of SplitView when targetting small WVGA/WXGA such as the Lumia 520/525/530 which have an extremely thin horizontal resolution compared to its available vertical space.
__label__0 I found one interesting thing when I try to install my apps of 3 different types (WP Silverlight 8, WP Silverlight 8.1 and Universal App) to the SD card.
__label__1 Because of this I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped.
__label__0 app that will allow to do all this to there live tiles ,backround and to the volume.
__label__0 It's especially frustrating while developing native html based apps.
__label__1 It would be nice to have a command-line tool to submit apps to the store.
__label__0 1.- Check if an ApplicationID is installed/purchased 2.- Share files between applications in something that could be called SharedStorageFiles instead of IsolatedStorageFiles.
__label__0 And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another.
__label__1 please make the theme beautiful by making the icons 4d.
__label__1 The OPML export feature should include tagging data.
__label__0 It is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control.
__label__1 High level WinRT has no built-in 3d graphics support like WPF does.

There are a few ways to draw 3d shapes: 1.

Create your own 3d library.

2

Use 3rd party managed 3d graphics library which is a wrapper around DirectX.

3

Use DirextX interop.

4

Use other tools like modelling software.

Cons: 1.

Very hard.

2

Issues resulted of mixing technologies that work in different ways, documentation is also 3rd party and may be poor, needs to learn separately, may be removed in the future, different from official documentation, not good at mixing with existing functions of the high level WinRT API.
__label__0 We have an app that at times adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl.
__label__1 Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less___ more
__label__0 But look what happens when i try (note the lower case i) to use the auto-complete, which is set to add a space after being used: it___ more
__label__0 There are some devs that are making multiple Windows Store accounts to spam the same repackaged apps.
__label__0 It's ridiculous that we cannot specify InputScope for AutoCompleteBox.
__label__0 Partiendo de nada conectar con el todo!!
__label__0 So when i click the search button i open the internet explorer.
__label__0 Any up___dates on the nested virtualization?
__label__0 Obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system can't be abused.
__label__1 I believe this should be a user based permission API in case the user doesn't want me to have this ability.
__label__0 It only allow the Customer Update SDK level.
__label__1 They are a welcome *addition* to the API but they should not be the *only* way to obtain data.
__label__0 I am a blogger and I want to make it easy for people to subscribe by having a flare unit for them to add my feed to their Feedly, but I simply cannot find a working flare unit to add to my feedburner.
__label__0 My two cents.
__label__0 Previously this is messy because it requires setting from C# code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code.
__label__1 If i have access to the FM radio APIs i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers not the headphones.
__label__0 Now it work, but...the the Header___ more

__label__1 Add a Boolean to the CameraCaptureTask to optionally add the picture taken to the Camera Roll.
__label__0 So it's possible to hold the Surface with 2 hands while being able to click on the button (like the Camera app...).
__label__0 At present, to pin an application to the desktop in all versions of Windows, one must find the executable file, right click on it, choose to create a shortcut, be told Windows can't create a shortcut here, and select Yes.
__label__0 Here is a simple example that I really have a hard time understanding.
__label__0 Any ideas, how do i report this,___ more
__label__0 I wished that PubCenter had a way of merging apps that I had in both platforms (Windows and Windows Phone), which obviously includes Universal Apps.
__label__0 We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.
__label__1 You can improve this feedback forum by making it work right.
__label__0 It is more convenient to go with swiping gestures is more fun being with than the tap method.
__label__0 So one of two options would be useful:
__label__1 weve got the worst supply of google apps we need these two to exist on this phone please please please add this we need it !
__label__1 We could also be able to start tracking packages directly too.
__label__0 If FlowDirection value equal to Auto and first character in the text string was type of RTL language Flow Direction set to RightToLeft and if that was type of LTR language Flow Direction set to LeftToRight
__label__0 This is the same error that was marked Completed here:
__label__0 Firstly, deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc. from Microsoft when the app users won't even be the general public.
__label__1 One thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately.
__label__0 -I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.
__label__1 File Transfer should pause when a call is made or comes in.
__label__0 With UMDF 2.0, you can write UMDF drivers that use C-style syntax and call many of the same methods that are available to KMDF drivers.___ But this is limited to phone makers OEMs.
__label__0 The old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that I no longer want to be published.
__label__0 Or even on a regular ol' website.
__label__0 More info: http://developer.ubuntu.com/web/
__label__0 Think of a 'Stocks' app where you see the price and change on the front, then tapping it shows the graph on the back.
__label__1 something like AntennaPod (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) would be very nice
__label__1 There should be alternative condensed and aligned with Win32 style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from UWP improvements.
__label__1 For my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised.
__label__1 It should be possible to create Visual Studio Centennial Project in WinForms WPF Win32 MFC etc which should also allow mixing of UWP Code (Like XAML UI) with full interop between native and UWP Platform.
__label__0 After the 7.5 to 7.8 update I was so thankful that the arrow icon (the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page!!)
__label__0 In doing some testing, it appears WinAppDeployCmd _may_ work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the 169.254.
__label__0 If an app can not be found with its ideal keyword (becuase over a hundred apps already have used that search term) then new apps cannot be found with their ideal search terms.
__label__0 Compile using cl test.cpp /MD and run under RS4.
__label__0 That's the only feature I'm missing in feedly.
__label__0 Currently (Windows Phone 8.1) if you store your credentials in the PasswordVault, they aren't deleted on app uninstall, so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available.
__label__0 Would be great to have these bugs fixed soon.
__label__0 I cannot expand FAQ entries and so on.
__label__1 So please before you completely remove SuppressSystemOverlays make sure there's a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode.
__label__0 ____________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________
__label__1 At the very least publishing on Xbox should be an opt in function when publishing - not an opt out one.
__label__1 Alternatively, a simple flattr-inspired donate function might do it. 
__label__1 Please add the capability to view voltage and mAh, or, if possible, another method to check if the device is charging with USB power or wireless power.

__label__0 User opens my application, click a button, Visual Search gets opened, users scan a barcode, clicks on the thumbnail result and is redirected to my application with information on the code.
__label__0 Then user can choose his own to be saved and use.

__label__0 All of the selected files are passed to your app as argument parameters.
__label__0 Thank you and best regards.

__label__1 I suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode (convert) an instance to and from a string.
__label__0 When there is a bulk update requirement as with the age ratings (and soon to be with the Ad support changes) the store is poorly equipped to server those of us that are managing large portfolios and millions of users.
__label__0 You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it ScrollBar goes upper.

__label__0 I installed the Chinese quick keyboard.
__label__1 Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).
__label__0 The rates are too low, so we have set the values manually 3.
__label__1 You should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for CR80 or business card and POS receipt paper wasn't stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved .
__label__0 I'm sure it's the app, because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems.
__label__0 This capability was essential for certain low-level tasks like native crash investigation, debugging stack clobbering scenarios, deep optimization with inline assembly (e. g. for NEON) and such.
__label__0 Which situation am I in?
__label__0 Even some of the ideas will ship in the next Update they haven't marked as planed or startet.
__label__1 I would like to be able to switch to another service without losing all of the tags I use to organize my source library.

__label__1 Increase webbrowser control function
__label__0 In India lot of students buy Notebooks with Windows 8.1 SL (Not pro).

But for developing and testing Windows Phone apps we need Windows Pro version with Hyper-V.

Thats why lot of students chose to develop for android, because of no special requirement.
__label__0 __________________WIN7________________________ _____________________________________ _____________________________________________________________
__label__1 With proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved.
__label__1 If this is working as designed, then I thing the NavigationUri in the Reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete, or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen.
