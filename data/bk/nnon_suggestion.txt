wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious problems
some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app
the store randomly gives the old xap or the new xap version of my app
my app has a wp version and a wp version xap in the same submission
the wp xap works only on wp and the wp xap works only for wp
sometimes the store gives the wrong wp xap version of my app to windows phone  users
currently if you ever mistakenly selected a ru language than you will be in a very bad situation forever    you can live with the wrong tile displayed for russian language in the store  the english one  or   you can publish an update with the removed ru language  but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble
the store will randomly deliver the old wrong version of your xap
i write a lot support ticket on this  but no one really cares on this issue
the engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following

also in italian translation  after reading sms  the device say fatto for ending operation but work only if i say ho finito
if i say fatto vocal command unrecognized

i ve been working on an lob for my field of engineering  civil structural
the point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls
and because the same app runs on tablets and pc s  our engineers can work in the field  come back to their office  and continue working with the same data on their pc s
because of windows   and windows phone   universal app  i am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well
all the saved and live data are saved on onedrive to allow roaming between the devices
but i ve found that windows phone   file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist
this aspect alone prevents any adaptation of my app to the windows phone platform
otherwise  it s not a real universal app

in windows phone  we were able directly access facebook through the people hub
comment on photos  write on walls without having to enter the facebook app
we were also able to switch between text messages and facebook messages on the fly

on my lumia  it takes significantly longer to do that now
it s slow
appointments have a remoteid but calendars don t
it would be easier to sync calendars if they have a remoteid like appointments

first of all  on windows phone   i always get an ioexception when trying to call pickcontactasync

although it is possible to define custom etw events  and to generate those events  the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events
the windows phone developer power tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events
there appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources
so although in  e g    net based store apps  the system diagnostics tracing eventsource class is available and can be used to generate custom etw events  there doesn t appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can t actually record those events in a trace
just to be clear  this is  not  a duplicate of http   wpdev uservoice com forums  dev platform suggestions  please provide etw logging from a windows phone    as a reply in that thread points out  you can already log etw events from a wp app

it used to sync so fast and was able to view the pictures under photo albums easily
and now the app takes long time to load
the same happened with facebook integration

i purchased the windows phone because of the smooth integration but now we are slowly moving towards apps and no os integration
microsoft provide a system event smsreceived for app to be notified when a sms received  we also need such event for phone call  such as phonereveived

applications use the api of the hub message for send view delete etc    sms  the message hub uses the api of others applications for the same thing  send view delete etc    messages
this means  that the developper have the ablity to implement other application apis in the message hub and use it
in some countries this does not work via provider services
just like on desktop ie
things i think about is like understanding dates and times

hoello  with wp  the silverlight xap apps are forced to use fast resume
this has broken my app swipe tunes as i hastilly submitted a wp  update with transparent tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc
fast resume has pretty much killed my app and i can t delete the wp  xap from the store  and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the wp store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers

google wallet has been able to do this for almost  years now

microsoft   pubcenter claims to have interstitials
however  these are just bigger ad formats and not the interstitials we know from other ad networks
interstitials are displayed at a break point in the app   game
therefore it is for the app   game developer much more important to have a good fill rate

it s supremely annoying while developing to have to go through the certification wait time just to add an in app purchase product to the dev center

when porting my windows  app to windows phone   i feel that the universal app template  which is already awesome  could do some other things to increase even more productivity     create pages and usercontrol folders  let s face it  unless we want to create sh     apps  we won t have the same ui for all platforms  so we ll end up creating the same pages and controls in both versions
vs could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes  pages and user controls  from the original project
i have stated the folder names i use  pages and usercontrols  but the rule could deal with other names as well
i use settingsflyouts and i took some time to replicate them as pages in the windows phone project
likewise  top and bottom app bars in windows  could be translated into the windows phone versions automatically  if for example buttons were found in those controls
do the same for styles xaml  or whatever file contains templates and styles  as done in
i believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken  but i only remember these  because i ported a very simple app
i have stated the folder names i use  pages    more
i wished that pubcenter had a way of merging apps that i had in both platforms  windows and windows phone   which obviously includes universal apps

in the windows store  i can choose trial mode for my app  and then pick the number of days i want the trial to last
from there  everything is taken care of for me
if the user uninstalls during a trial  it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later
contrast this with the windows phone world  where the developer indicates trial mode in the store  but has to manually track the number of days since install  whether the user has purchased  etc
if the user uninstalls and installs again later  the developer has no idea
adding trial mode in windows phone feels like implement and pray
i absolutely love the windows store implementation
contrast this with the windows phone world  where the developer indicates trial mode in the store  but has to manually track the number of days    more
some times its hard to navigate few times to same location
it would be much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports  which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows  windows phone
it is quite hard to find a solution to something you never heard about before but with the right pointers keywords it could be done efficiently and nearly effortlessly
as example for an obvious issue and easy solution  if you know something about the problem  my app failed certification because of dark light theme problems
i set the background to a fixed color  black  in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by windows phone automatically  hence no text is readable
this problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case
adding the following four lines to a report  that probably has been sent out thousands of times  would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading                         this might help with dark light theme problems       visibility application current resources phonedarkthemevisibility   or similar    brush application current resources phonebackgroundbrush                          and maybe additional links to documentation it would be much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports  which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows  windows phone

we are publishing the same apps in windows phone store and windows app store
unfortunately we are not able to set the prices in both marketplace same way
in windows app store we can choose the price tier
for all countries prices are automatically set
in windows phone store we are able to set the price for each county separately
exchange rate between us  and     is too low
the rate is set to
because we calculate our prices in     we have to change the   price for all countries with   manually and there are a lot of countries to change

currently it is not possible to change the package identity name of an app once it has been published  which is a bit frustrating
users don t like to wait  when they click on app

this gives them impression that my app is slow
let normal http    uris to be able to send notifications to the app using the window external notify and not only the https    uris
give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the scriptnotify event or not
most probably you will have to collaborate with google but this is the challenge

apps on windows phone were able to run under the lock screen for quite some time
the new universal app model does not provide this functionality

currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access
the documentation on the windows phone socialintegration namespace is also limited

currently i m developing an app for posting photos to a user s picasa account
a user has requested that the app provide functionality to edit a given photo from their account and upload a new version
i don t think it s best of my resources to implement this functionality when there are so many great photo editing apps already on the market
the user can then do some function within the selected app  e g
this would extend the power already available with share pickers to perform more generic tasks  and would result in a better experience for the user
all this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the os has
this should be available both in winrt and silverlight applications
the user can then do some function within the selected app    more

this is not a breaking change
current users are not expecting any return in the success continuation  so they not check for any returned value

that the store team needs to ingest the app and provide it to the store
apple provides a similar capability via itunes connect  https   developer apple com library mac documentation languagesutilities conceptual itunesconnect guide  addingnewapps addingnewapps html
this capability would not only enhance the submission experience  but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in the developer s source control system  e g   tfs  git
as a starting point  it would be fine for the developer to download from the dev center a  starter template  that is a zip file with basic xml templates and placeholder filenames  which the developer could then tweak modify for the app she wants to submit
this capability would not only enhance the submission experience  but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in    more
i want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by dpe east africa
there is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like windows testing devices
certain people request for devices and get immediately
unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality
any one here can see its down right nepotistic
i launch this complaint on behalf of others and in good faith
kindly i urge you to look at this matter
thanks in advance
currently it is supported on windows phone only
http stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone  that could be use for hosting webpage  downloading files from phone via browser etc
for instance  i click a hyperlinked phone number and i am given the option to call with the phone  or skype
same for maps  youtube links  website links  that also have an app   etc
currently a file is simply flagged as deleted
the file is not removed from storage
in todays criminal government spy world  simply flagging a file as deleted does not secure it from prying eyes
the actual erasure can be a background process
also consider adding a group policy to enforce erasure
right now its impossible to create a custom playlist in a media player app without transferring all the songs to iso
it will be very easy if the classes are immutable and song collection class can be used simply as a list where one can add or remove song just like other collections so that mediaplayer play songcollection coll  can be used more effectively

currently its very hard to debug hybrid and webapps
when you create a webview you simply cannot see the dom or any normal information to see whats going on  what goes wrong and why it goes wrong
platforms like ios and android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser
when you connect an iphone to a mac you can view the webview from safari by going to develop  debug
and voor android devices you open chrome and go to about devices
this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong  and with ie a lot can go wrong  ie is better but still not as easy to make cross platform apps run like on android and ios
you can now only see the console  but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn t show errors   not even the dom
let alone inspect resources  timeline and html css javascript errors
with frameworks like angular  node  jquery  etc becoming more popular  we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience
this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong  and    more
currently  apps can be transferred between accounts  retaining  i believe  all ratings  users  app id  etc
this can be done through a support ticket
however  apps with in app purchases are not eligible to be transferred
not even if the iaps are completely removed from the app and deleted from the developer account
if the app ever had an iap  it is not eligible for transfer
i understand why this might not have been a high priority  but as the platform grows it seems absolutely necessary
i have apps i would like to transfer  which had iaps  but i cannot do so
the reason i removed the iaps was to make the apps eligible for transfer
quite unfortunate
reasons to transfer an app    transfer ownership to a different person or group   ex  an app is purchased by a different company
logistically  i can imagine the nightmare that might be
at the very least  if iaps are removed from the app and deleted from the dev account  the app should become transferable
i have apps i would like to transfer  which had iaps  but i cannot do    more

when you apply new policies on already existing  especially if it is related to name  all the existing credibility and market is lost
app is in store with current policies at that time  there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff
when you are developing an app  the generic policies will make sense
but when a developer submitted an app and it s failing for a reason policies  it s worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his her app
what are the things went wrong  rather than saying your app failing on    it s generic message  will be no use  as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies
if you simply say an app failed with the policy number   or so  what can a developer benefit out of it  rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times  it will be frustrating
after a little while  developer may think that  anyway they are not going thru  what s the point in spending time here
may be this works with a firm company  but for independent developers you are the source   you are the helper
if you simply say an app failed with the policy number   or so  what can a developer benefit out of it  rather he will be more    more
windows  phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the calculator app
i find myself having to manually tab out get figures  enter them in
windows  phone
copy any number of the internet   documents and try and put it into calculator app
you will find you have to do it manually
namely the file that was replaced
it would make chaining additional operations much more easier
having to re enter things like version number  application name  etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes
in the app manifest i ve already put the version number  and i ve already put the application name
when i upload this xap to the store  look at the manifest and pre populate the corresponding fields in my submission instead of giving me a chance to mismatch them

currently when the dialogue with first level of windows phone store support is broken there is not any option to reach higher level and talk with someone who could resolve any kind of misunderstanding
windows phone support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there
and unbelievably they are doing exactly that
azure support system is a very good example how this should work
in every communication emails the support officer s manager and generic escalation emails are included
microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers  who are using that same publisher s applications will be left without further updates and improvements
the ability to have video on live tiles

there are some bugs in notification center if there are so many notifications in notification center then it lags when i scroll it down   i don t know that others are facing this problem or not but i think its a major issue
i found something  which i think of as serious security bug
i ll start with the fact that i ve got nokia l ith wp  preview for developers
what else could be important is that i ve set additional security code  so i ve got two codes  first for sim card and second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity
i noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone i can skip sim code  simply by pulling the screen down   like clsing an app   and then i only need to type my internal code  in about   cases sim code panel will pop up  but in the other   no
i can use all phone features except calling  but getting access to other data is terrifying too
i checked it a few times
so my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only sim code
and what may cause that phenomenon

currently windows phone is very restricted for developers
it is not at all flexible
whatsapp cant send audios  truecaller cant interpret incoming calls  we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too

the new geolocator api and implementation is so unreliable  that it can t be used with any confidence in a product
problems i have encountered    while using positionchanged event geolocator reportinterval seems to be ignored
the simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval  phones seem to ignore it completely e g
reportinterval set to  second  the phone would regularly take     seconds and sometimes minutes to report
as a developer i expect the reportinterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy
if the phone doesn t have an accurate location  simply return what it does have
getpositionasync   and getgeopositionasync timespan  timespan  regularly never return
because the event based location reporting is unreliable i have tried to use these apis instead  unfortunately they are also unreliable
the getgeopositionasync method will work maybe  times in a row and then simply stop working and never return    despite having a timeout parameter
in general the api is poorly designed
changing properties on an active gelocator causes exceptions
getting the geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical  and undocumented  setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers i e
the api is too implicit it works on side effect rather than deliberate commands
if the phone doesn t have an accurate location  simply return what it does    more

currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history  after     apps updated  was selected in notification center    expand menu bar   select downloads   swipe to history
that key combination is still free and the most logical place for a quick menu

whatsapp and other apps use the default sound
all other messages
for example app submission certification gives you there was a problem processing this request
please try again after a few minutes in firefox

hi  currently wp  allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi
then  when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect  it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too
how s that for security
lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available
if the phone is stolen  and it is password locked  it s still possible to take photos  if enabled
the thief may take a photo  but if only the wifi backup option is enabled  but there is no wifi available for the phone  then the picture stays in the phone
but if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data  then it would be available for the phone s real owner
the thief could take a picture of him herself  then it can be given to police  and or give idea of his her location
then  when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect  it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud    more

i understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from
e g
a german review should only be shown in germany  and maybe in switzerland and austria
what i don t understand is  that you also showing the app rating in countries  were they come from
for example  an app has  ratings
from germany  all with  stars    from usa   star  and  from france   stars  if you now open the app in the windows phone store from germany  you will see a total app review rating of    stars
if you open the app in the us windows phone store  it shows only  rating with  star
in france it shows  ratings with  stars and in all other countries it shows  ratings
the total rating should be equal worldwide

right now it is very difficult  and completely undocumented  to determine if a photo or picture is marked as a favorite by a user  or to retrieve a list of favorites  similar to getting the list of pictures in the knownfolders cameraroll  etc
if a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites  we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications

a translate this website button like is has on desktop and chrome also would be much helpful on a mobile device
these properties will allow developers to introduce many useful features such as auto playlists  and it ll also help xbox team to bring back recently added feature
full unsafe code support would    allow more code to be shared across platforms  and   increase the performance of applications that needed it
here s a use case example  i m the author of bepuphysics  a real time simulation library
i wish to support many platforms as best i can with as much common code as possible
unfortunately  in the current situation  i can t have the best of both worlds
if my goal is optimal performance  i must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low level queries and data structures
on the other hand  if my goal is as much common code as possible  i m forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator  crippling all of the other platforms
over time  these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isn t as fast as it could be
while using c   could provide the necessary access and performance  many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine grained that dropping to c   from c  repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower
a full native implementation would address the performance side of things  but i can t justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform
it would also destroy a lot of value for the c  based users of the library
even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn t allow unsafe code  enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the pc
this would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone
on the other hand  if my goal is as much common code    more

i have an image x with file size kb and it does not load
load error
in the app dev archive the photos are x
i cannot get directions for transit and walk but for drive in the maps for wp
also  it is pretty slow
currently  the windows phone sdk installs all the components within the sdk  including the emulator
however  not all devices are compatible  and the emulator images take up a large amounts of space and take lengthy times to download
users without compatible hardware are forced to download an unnecessary portion of the sdk without the ability to skip this feature
tile can show s video
manage my total apps purchase by deleting the unwanted apps from the total list similar like google store    and also give the ability to filter my payment purchased apps
and then launch the calendar
so if i get a cortana alert or new email and i m playing cod i can see it
nofificaiones center had to be moved from the left meego guy already looks better and cleaner and so would not be copied anyone since nokia who introduced this feature as bought a nokia  also all in the family

in some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class
there must be a way to handle this kind of problem  like statistics on how many times an app was started  or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps
the sd card support in wp is practically useless because built in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as  reserved file and uri associations
http   msdn microsoft com en us library windowsphone develop jj v vs   aspx  this means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the sd card
many wp devices ship with only gb  which makes the use of the sd card essential  especially to store large files  such as video
we are presently working on a wp version of an app to play sign language videos  but are stymied by this restriction
we cannot read  or even see  any  mp files on the sd card
this limitation basically stops our project for wp
of course  we have ios and android versions that work on phones
our own project aside  it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any third party apps from competing with the built in apps
just looking at the list of reserved file types   seems like all file types known to man are reserved
and then i remind myself that this is just on the sd card
but then what is the point of the sd card  if the developer is restricted to the phone s internal memory
we cannot read    more
there is ssl tls socket support in windows phone

this is third time i am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone  doesn t provide a good background service
running of background service just for  seconds every  minutes is restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients
my client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company   and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running   which we successfully implemented in android and ios
but because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product

few days before updating the latest windows app studio  i can still install into my phone
but after this new version and generation into wp and w   i manage once with success installation but now can t be installed and always asked for install from store
currently  app can only access them through office
that made all document viewing editing app has a terrible user experience
and user may not understand how to open some type of files
if the microsoft force users to use office or force developers to use skydrive by this way  may take the opposite result  and lost users and developers
however if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted
or for instance we are in a setup wizard we don t want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup

it looks like instances of audiovideocapturedevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated
the disposal appears to be done in the runtime code  as none of my disposal code runs in these situations
this is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and activatedeventargsisapplicationinstancepreserved    true  because all application memory should be intact
but it isn t  because the audiovideocapturedevice instance has been auto magically disposed
this can be difficult to detect if the device is used in a deeply embedded object
my idea is that you are using tour own agenda and then notice the poor synchronising performance of it with google agenda

i recently asked myself how long an app takes to get in the store
especially if there are deadlines to fulfill  it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified
all other steps are working really smooth but the pending certification is taking up to  days without showing any progress
is there a way to add a progress  i e

at the moment there are only apis for reading and writing nfc tags
unfortunately this is only a very small part of the nfc capabilities
with an iso smartcard support  you would be able to communicate with smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via nfc credit cards
these capabilities are well supported by other platforms and i would like to see this support on wp too
have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews
if so then this issue should concern you as a developer
the app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in
so for example if an app is published in canada and the united states and only the users in canada leave a rating reviews then the users in the united states will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app
this also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying  or not enjoying  the app
i understand there may be some issues with language etc
and an easy way to implement is to do this  asides from bing translating                                              wonderful app name        user reviews worldwide       reviews in your market                                         this way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews
ratings and reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would microsoft bother having them
ratings and reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal    after all who would you rather believe  the seller s ads or user reviews of the app
not all of us are the instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get
so if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it
this also gives the    more
the idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device
currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real time as and when it happens
this reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction
this is one of the important feature required in windows phone dev report

from an old suggestion which got declined    phone off  locked    reminder comes up  reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped    user taps over reminder  then unlocks  target app is not launched expected  tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app  just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up
see http   wpdev uservoice com forums  app platform suggestions  bug click on reminder will not open target app w  i really hope microsoft can resolve this issue  because it is clearly a bug and it definitely does not work as designed
currently  the only options i have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze  or ignore or the back button
furthermore  without any scientific proofs  i assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked  so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time
i can understand that tapping on the reminder    more

recently i read about new winphone   features  and one of the which had took my attention  is the notification area
on the winpho  video  it works like android and ios
you pull from the top to down  and the notification area appears
for example  to show the notification area  you swipe from left to right
when a notification appears  you have  options  swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area  or swipe the notification from bottom to up to ignore it  or press it to open the application related to the notification
this notification  in my opinion  will make winpho stills a different os from android and ios
i hope to contribute  to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone
i hope you like it
thank you and best regards

tl dr  creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem
now  that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot  so you modify that with ratings
for example  my app is currently fairly well reviewed    stars
however  it never gets good visibility because it isn t the best  which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions
in this way  every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day  while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps
my two cents
import alert tones
sometimes they re much more useful than data binding  for example  when i need a staticresource as a property value
as an app seller  i have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while
since apps aren t allowed to modify files on sd cards i wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been disliked and then remove them
however this is impossible with all existing api s
i am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact s details and re create them in your own ui    which would be great if the api exposed all of the user s details  like the anniversary  which it does not
also  having a showcontacttask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on twitter or facebook without having to implement those sdks  especially since the apis do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles

thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else  i changed the name slightly

i later found that the original submission had also been successful  even though it had hung  so that there were now two duplicate submissions in processing certification with slightly different aliases

currently we have access to external mass storage
currently  the only way to upload the user files to the iso storage is to use the cloud like services  skydrive
it does not make a sense when the large  multimedia  files have to be transferred  you first have to transfer them up to skydrive and then   download to phone
it would be great if the part of the application iso store could be made visible in the windows file explorer when the phone is connected by the usb cable

now on windows phone  when we have  resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time
you have to run one emulator  take screenshots  close it and run another and so on
we can scale wxga to wvga it still requires some work   because they have the same ratio  but we can t do this with p
emulators are even slower than the wp  ones  so the process is really long
consider also option where you have application in several languages
you have to take screenshots in one language  change it to another  wait until emulator reloads and so on
it takes a lot of time
it would save us a lot of time

in wp  the default pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the phonefontfamilysemibold and phonefontsizemedium styles  but the standard blank page template still uses phonetextnormalstyle  which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size  for the page title

currently  microsoft phone info devicestatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from c  project making it a round way about to include this project in c     managed code
if you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working
it fires the navigating event but not the navigated event
seems that it is waiting to receive credential but no popup is showed
after this the control is no more usable the only option is to close the application and reload all
after the   to   update i was so thankful that the arrow icon  the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page
was taken off to leave more room for the icons on the homescreen
however there is still a mm gap at the top of the page  not including the space for the time etc  that is wasteful
it s so annoying
the webclient type doesn t allow me to use cookies stored by the web browser control and i ll have to ask the user for credentials which they ve already stored in the form of cookies through the login page of a particular site in the web browser
there is an indirect way of using browserhttp but it s kinda buggy
the leak of a medialibrary savevideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user
if we can see the current voltage level  we can determine if the phone is plugged in to usb power  or utilizing an induction charger
certain wp phones have wireless or inductive charging  and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers
a thick phone case  or simply not centering the phone on the charging plate can result in reduced charging capacity and much longer charging times
adding visbility to the battery mah would then allow battery health apps  charger comparisons  and inductive charger efficiency  or inneficiency
i hope you get the point
option to browse in private
reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day
currently it is impossible to pause in in progress backgroundtransferrequest
this would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download
the majority of apps i see at the marketplace doesn t have any review s
i think that has an overall negative effect  user wise  community wise and dev wise   maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it
i know that thinking up such a system isn t easy  as you would have to think carefully about abuses
there is currently no indication that an application is being featured  it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates   countries it will be featured in

does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources
is there any way to select  a  location source s  to use  like on other platforms
some especially for mobile useful css features like ms scroll chaining  snap points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie  which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries
it s especially frustrating while developing native html based apps
bb has this as a standard feature out of the box  while rd party apps are available under ios  though not half as good as the bb
this is particularly helpful when activesync has not been enabled
if the information is available from a browser  it should be available to an app
i want to be nice about this one    but  seriously
why is it impossible to get the contact designated by the system as me  for the purposes of getting my current picture
why should i have to implement a contactpicker to make the user choose  or implement the live sdk and force them to log in  when the phone already knows
there are more and more external sensors  not only medical  but all kind of proximity stuff for watches  smart apliances  cars  and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps
as usual microsoft is late in this too  and so we have to focus development on ios and android that have the sdk up to date with technology
app will not upload photos

this would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device
this is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog  but being able  as a developer
to add more colors to that list from your app
windows phone  includes a new map control
it has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names
street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center
to add a route to the map you have to create maproute object that accepts only route object in it s constructor
but route object does not have public constructor
the only possibility to create route is routequery class
this is a problem
routequery uses online service to calculate the route
apps can t show the traveled route at real time on the map  like jogging apps
because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently
it is possible to workaround this with mappolyline
but the polyline is shown over the street names
street names color stays black and not being centered
possible solution  route class implements iroutepath
maproute constructor should accept iroutepath inteface instead of route class
apps can t show the traveled route at    more

windows phone  may have  new resolutions  but it only actually has two aspect ratios    scaling and   scaling  accessible through app current host content scalefactor
because wvga and wxga are the same aspect ratio  and because the website is a giant pita in uploading images  you have to take and submit  screenshots per actual screenshot per language
screenshots in two languages turns into  screenshots  which is totally nuts
that would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app

hi  i am developing an app that play remote mp file via internet using mediaelement
this app has no issue on windows phone
but on both windows phone  emulator and device  nokia lumia    there are  problems    downloadprogress property often returned   right after video if opened
video size is  gb so it must take long time to get   value
this problem happens randomly
we can see the issue by playing youtube video or play video in metrotube  tube pro app
sometimes when i seek the video by changing position property  i ve got a trouble with infinite loop of buffering and video never play again
i had to re open video and change the position property again and sometimes this problem is disappeared
please see the log text below to understand circumstance
this problem also happen randomly
once again  these problems do not happen on wp  so i d like to see if these are known issues on wp os and hope to see the fix soon
one more issue  seeking and opening video time in windows phone are quite long in comparison with ios

wp sdk provides file type association http   utorrentideas uservoice com forums   c btorrent for windows suggestions  torrent file association in windows phone  please provide the same feature in wp
making it possible to change iso in video mode
the fact that we have to go through c   to exploit such key resources as dx  dd  drawingsurfaces in w  wpf  wp is  not  acceptable
sharpdx proves that those key technologies can be made available to csharp  i would suggest to either support the project  or to provide your own interface

hello sir ma am
i mean we can access system files  registry etc  like we can do with our pc
if you think that which users have buy your windows phone  with contract they can misuse it then please left them and unlock that phone who has buy windows phone  without any contract and have factory unlock here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any sim  if you think that if you unlock windows phone  then which users don t have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt delete system files  in this case i wanna suggest you that you can make windows phone  fully unlock option  means if any user want to unlock windows phone  then he she can unlock it
sir ma am some uses have buy windows phone  only then because they was thinking that in windows phone  they can access system files and can be able to modify their windows phone  according to their need and as they want  but you break our heart    you can think that if windows phone  will be fully unlock then some users can illegally copy applications from one windows phone  to another windows phone
but all will not do it
some wanna use fully unlocked windows phone  for fun
like me i wanna to do that things which i ve done in my windows   like change icons  add more colors of tiles which are not available in list
plz plz unlock it
it is not only my request  it is requested by millions of users
i hope you will think about it and take a decision in my favor

this must be one of the most basic auto corrects
it is used a lot  almost as much as the comma and full stop
lastly  you can enter a full stop and a space by hitting space twice  like this
but look what happens when i try  note the lower case i  to use the auto complete  which is set to add a space after being used  it won t subsequently recognise the double space  like so this should be new sentence  but instead i have three spaces

my game icon was designed to have a transparent background  but when i published it and saw it listed in the game hub  the transparent background was not filled with the user s theme color as it would have been in the app list or when pinned to the home screen

cant work without it
when accidentally hitting x button while typing email  offer cancel in addition to save and delete
adding this api would make room for rd party messaging apps and phone management apps
like connectionsettingstask  this task permit to open localization settings page from application
this task is useful for app that use bing map that must check is localization service is active and permit to offer to user an shortcut to edit this setting  like standard map app

hi  as we know  there is a lot of limitations is wp os due the high security in the os itself which is very good  but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works  apps which we trust i e  hotmail app  facebook app  skype app
the idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest  or the app can ask for trust so if the user agrees the app will be shown in the trusted app center in the settings with its extra permissions requested
as an example for the trusted app center settings    myownemailclient app permission requested    send email  without user intervention    send sms  without user intervention    manage contacts  read write        and so on
facebook app   manage contacts  read write    send sms
navigation uri doesn t work if the reminder alarm ring under lockscreen
it s annoying having to download and install the toolkit separately
how is it that there is no check all button for the list of email messages
we have two pages the main tile page and then all apps
included with biometric framework out of box supply facial recognition module using front facing camera
ability to block incoming calls   sms  text messages  from specific phone numbers  within a list configured by the user
every app places the search control in different areas  often hidden under a sub section of the app
a new tile  who is be a folder
when you click this tile you open a folder with different apps
and rebind of the serach button
i am from russia  and bing don t work here
so when i click the search button i open the internet explorer
i would like to register a url with my application so that when someone clicks http   www mydomain com  in the browser or is redirected to the browser from another application they are given the option to open my application instead of the browser
with default options etc
this would be good in windows  too
the smilies are displayed as colon  dash parentheses signs
in windows mobile    this library exist  and it s very good for retreive lot of cell tower informations   cell id  mnc  mcc  lac  imei  imsi   lot of information we do not have access with windows phone
the alarm and reminder classes in microsoft phone scheduler are very limiting and do not allow for any customization
ideally these classes would be extended to accept a usercontrol object that would be shown instead of the standard title
from there the application could be fully launched if desired
when scrolling down list or opening item in list  app catalog hangs
i assume the catalog is hanging for a moment while loading data  however there is no indicator and the result is a jerky experience
it doesn t increase the wish to develope the product
where can i vote for showing sales up to limit  usd
i currently have wp sdk installed and i am not able to get the emulator working consistently
in phone setting missing direct commands for enable disable verify
it is physically impossible for me to play my game in the emulator and capture an image of it that actually represents what gameplay looks like
my game is controlled by the accelerometer and has very rapid gameplay that makes switching from using the accelerometer to screenshot tab and actually capturing a screenshot impossible
it simply doesn t work
in order to take the screenshot it takes  mouse clicks and about half a second
if i am lucky i can do it before my character dies  even then though the player is just moving in a straight line to nowhere by the time i actually take the screenshot
as such i can t capture the gameplay occurring in my game
in window mobile open an endroid market
i think microsoft provide azure cloud computing free for developer
no need to feel up credit card details
this just helps make advertising easier  without listing individual apps
for details and a workaround that s not working as smooth as it is when it was implemented in the control itself

on android  there is a great app that lets you backup your sms messages

there are heaps and heaps of really good developers outside of us who really want to contribute to making windows phone a preferred choice  so please microsoft  make    more

copy this text  and paste it to the to  box in the new message expected       actual

hi microsoft  i would like to report a bug certain html code that causes the inbox to crash instantly upon viewing the email
i m not sure if this can be abused as we ve seen on mango where the phone is non responsive upon receiving a specially crafted text via notification
i do not wish to leave it out there
i m searching for a way to send an sms to a sms service number  end then handle the received sms with reply information to the sent sms
all to automate a sms srvice
from what i ve found i need to use  smscomposetask mysms   new smscomposetask    mysms body   thesmstextcodemsg     some code to ask for information from the sms service mysms to   thesmsservicenumber  mysms show    and then the user have to confirm the sms sending     no way to send automaticly from the app
then the sms service sends a response
is it possible
and i want to get that response to my app to hanle it     more
for example  i needed to rebrand one of my apps  and while it appears under its new name in marketplace  i can t change it to the new name in app hub
as a recent purchaser of a windows phone  i love the platform  and it has huge potential to grow in competition with android and apple
i am concerned however that microsoft are not pushing enough for access to successful top selling apps  which are popular on the iphone and android platforms e g
instagram
if windows phones are to compete they have to acknowledge the big selling apps  or they risk losing market share rather than gaining it
i m developing an app containing data that a user might want to keep in view for a while  without worrying about accidentally pressing any of the hardware buttons  thereby exiting the current view
maybe the normal screen timeout would apply here as well  rather than the lock screen timeout
if the screen turned off  pressing the unlock button would again display my page  maybe with a built in label at the bottom  instructing the user to slide to unlock
if the screen turned off  pressing the unlock button would again display my page  maybe with a built in label at the bottom     more
on the windows phone website  my account shows all the apps i downloaded  but after resetting my phone  i was forced to remember which ones were useful vs useless
selectionchanged is the best handler for this use  and it behaved as it should
using mouseleftbuttonup will randomly activate when dragging and lifting your finger  which is an unwanted result for a menu
not really sure where to put this  so i m going to ask here
i really really loved the now playing screen on the zune hd  like the current zune software  with information and stuff moving over the artist background  which panned
is there any way microsoft could integrate this into the next version of windows phone
it was a great idea  and i m sad to see it go with the zune hd and not move over to windows phone
when we are on call and  the same time i want to look up for a number from phone book  i can t do it right now
i ll have ro out the other caller on hold to get a number
at the moment there s no way for an app to know if its primary live tile is visible or not
although the native screenshot feature is reported to not be available until windows phone   i have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact windows phone  apps as well
since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my windows phone  app  i do not consider this off topic
i am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps
i am concerned about security and drm issues
will microsoft provide an api that will allow us to
programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app
if so  what happens to existing windows phone  apps that run on a windows phone  device
will screen shots work by default for windows phone  apps
if so  and there is no api to restrict usage for existing windows phone  app  but there will be an api to restrict functionality for windows phone  app  i may want to wait for windows phone  before deploying my app
programmatically enable or disable the feature    more
so that we can trigger our application on such events
at the moment developers do not have any control on such tasks
and its very frustrating to see other platforms like  android and blackberry  developers can easily do it
so that i can manage the phone  send messages  manage apps  account  settings and so on
all this by using the bigger and faster interface of the computer
i do really like the idea of contract in windows
will this feature included in wp
application should run in background

the phone language and settings are uk english
russian is used only as additional keyboard layout  the bug mentioned above got a lot worse since last wp update  if you reproduce steps    you will get a message with actually  broken  e mail headers
this is really frustrating  considering that this bug was there for more than  months
also  similar bug was spotted in native twitter client  then uploading a picture to pic twitter com  original tweet is displayed as
instead of non english characters
russian is used only as additional keyboard    more
apps written for wp will not work on wp
ok  fine
however  in order to be able to support  both  platforms  we are going to want some extensions on the wp side in order to support wp features that are not available on the older platform

moreover  recently geotrust claimed us to cancel us registration  current one  and re register as russia
indeed  we re discouraged and not happy
there is no default property or method of listbox control which will give us the currently binded items on view or carousel control for wp
bingmapsdirectionstask  only set start point  when the task is running  it s prompt getting directions   it s alert end point not found  we couldn t find a match for your ending point

i cloud be only set the start point or not
currently we have to download and configure the silverlight toolkit to get certain ui elements that should really be integrated with the platform
there is lack of support for digitally signing x client certificates
also there is no support for storing certificates in certificate store using  net code and located in the device
facilidade para definir qualquer mp como toque  e transfer  ncia de arquivos sem a necessidade do zune  pois    rid  culo ter de utilizar um programa ruim sem poder definir as coisas da maneira que eu quero
machine translation  up the phone more tramp in the market if you can set music as ringtone  alarms etc   as in windows i have to create ringtone facility to define any mp as a ringtone  and transfer of files without the need of zune  it is ridiculous to have to use a bad program without being able to set things up the way i want
open the damn thing up
less than   market share and the platform is more locked up than my wife s vagina
had a great idea for an app and after  seconds of research i found it was impossible to do with wp
there does not seem to be a way to control newlines in the application descriptions on the marketplace
i would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for windows phone if microsoft    more
one public folder with full access as flash memory with configurable size
that folder would be available for all apps
currently i know of developers creating deep link tiles from xaml in their application  so the idea isn t too far off
this came up while talking to other developers at a few talks meetups  not because i created the largest vector based creative commons icon pack for windows phone that many of you use already
currently i know of developers creating    more
in short  now that we can have multiple tiles  sure  it s great that they can open the app
but why not let us flip the tile instead  note  the mail tile would  always  open the app
think of a  stocks  app where you see the price and change on the front  then tapping it shows the graph on the back
perhaps a double tap opens the app like they do now
social networking apis  like facebook  are constantly adding new features
proving access to the authentication directly  even if it were temporary  would allow applications to use the most up to date social networking sdk to provide better features for their users
if the user did not have an account configured for that provider  they could be given the chance to create one  or simply redirected to the social network providers website
i like to keep my start screen tidy with relatively few apps  but the alphabetized list is cumbersome when i forget the name of an app
lets keep the automatic adjustment of screen brightness with manual compensation that increases or decreases the value automatically set
i know that storage and storing information is limited to the application context
i m android developer  i ve been through interoperability guide and read about this
i ve been wondering if something can be done through the silverlight  but all that failed since read that
cheers
on all the     buttom right  where i can share etc i would like to be able to print
it needs to be and integrated part of the phones functionality  that is why i put it in framework
no app driven solution
having a lot of i gear  iphone  ipads etc that can print  it is dissappointing not beeing able to use the equipment i already own
i m sure a lot of potential customers have the same contemplations but decides to stay on ios instead of switching
can you not make connection to these    more
de una buena vez quiten la interfaz metro  se ve bien desde una app de escritorio  pero en el m  vil es horrible
this is experienced on a nokia lumia   os version
for instance  normally a stock price tile updates every  minutes via a background task  but if you tap it  the quote updates instantly
or perhaps you have a tile that shows you where you are  restarurant or wherever  and you simply tap it to check in there
no need to open the app
since it s user initiated  it wouldn t drain the battery

silverlight for windowsphone provides basic  built in binding validation through the binding validatesonexceptions property  as documented in the silverlight data binding topic
however  the phone versions of the controls do not provide validation templates
to support validation  one option is to re template the controls to provide your own validation template
for example  you can customize the desktop version of the template provided in the textbox styles and templates topic

security is a concern and in this case that means access to data or performing undesired operations
additionally  the app itself is responsible for what it exposes  and it would not be able to chain access to any other area   only data in its isolated storage space for functions that are allowed as tasks
lastly  app submission testing would ensure that the app plays nicely in what it offers
consider the following    class myappchooser   chooser   public choose        give list of saved music or list of sites from news feeds     class myapplauncher   launcher   public launch        kick off app function such as playmusic   or showfeed       when developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing launchers and choosers as tasks to access certain data or perform an operation

hls becomes more and more popular to stream live video contents on mobile devices
is there any plan to support this protocol in wp
if not  what is the recommended solution
p as   computer owners have installed flash plugin in web browser  so it s naturally that flv or swf flash videos are more acceptable than popular videos formats  such as mp  avi  mpeg or ect

i have a great app idea going but i am missing one feature  the ability to upload music
we have the photochoosertask which works great and does the job  but we do not have access to music on the device
the reason i think this should be allowed is because there are many artists who make their own music that are new and put their music on the device

the abillity to search  and get results are crucial to a good user experience
let us say i wan t to find a bicycle repair shop
bing doesn t find any for me  the nearest is in australia  which is a bit far from denmark
km or so
using the google app  i find some nearby  but i guess the google app doesn t have my exact location
well from ie you can also search
but let us say i visited the bicycle page  from google  and want to search for   sunglasses    to buy when i go to town anyway    the search in ie is yet again the bing thing
get it  i do not want bing
as long as it can t give me relevant search results  keep the darn thing away from my phone
i would like and recommend the phone to others  but this is just too big an issue to overlook
i m sure fixing the phone is easiest  fastest and cheapest

many small developers skip brazil and korea from worldwide distribution because there are mandatory rating agency requirements

the current developer ecosystem for windowsphone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the marketplace
internal use of apps is defined as a beta test and requires a list of live ids designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app
this is very limited and also time consuming
ideally  a company may wish to dedicate a group of live ids as testers to be used each time
for this cost  a company would receive two unlocked windowsphone devices that could be traded or upgraded
this allows a team to use these devices for testing  as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations
the enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level   either in house or to clients
the targeted distribution approach doesn t seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients
it could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app marketplace
together  this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices
this would enable apps like skype to work in background and show incoming call nobtification

when i type a text message and need to go back to a different app  to copy a phone number to paste into the text message for example   i lose what i have typed when i come back to the text message editor  which is very frustrating
can this be possible on the phone
it will allow code anywhere anytime on windows idea
when you create a tile dynamically  it is common to want to save it as a png file so that it uses transparency  so that it respects the theme accent color
however  there is no built in method to save a writeablebitmap as a png
there is however a nice extension to save it to jpg  but that doesn t help if you want to use transparency to leverage the theme accent color in your tile
i think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue
to load the mobile turn off and the alarm works with the phone off to my core
for instance  if i build a children s book app and then submit that same app  times  each time with a different name and book loaded  i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen  thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design
all subsequent children s book apps will be essentially undiscoverable no matter how good they are    start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word  such as childrens stories so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps

i am using a open source api called openstack storage  http   openstack org projects storage   that requires passing empty headers to remove certain custom metadata entries
the library being used by wp  httpwebrequest  doesn t allow passing empty headers
it is unacceptable simply because according to rfc  section    header field definitions   the message headers of an http   message value is optional
this is limiting me to provide customers to fully use my app for stuff like removing entries on their objects
the error i receive is something like the header xxxxx has an empty value

windows phone breaks from ios and android by removing the need to open an app to share pictures and statuses by adding a sharing api

there are several certification requirements from microsoft that are impossible to test without a physical windows phone device
the requirements that involve phone calls  text messages  and zune hub music are all impossible to test from within the emulator
in trying to develop a custom playlist application  it is apparent that it is impossible to integrate the backgroudaudioplayer with the xna medialibrary
this means that applications that wish to use the capabilities of the backgroundagent are restricted to using only local audio files that are deployed with teh application  or audio streaming sources
there is no way to access the phone s medialibray songs to have the bap play these files in teh background
this is highly restrictive because we can only use the mediaplayer for foreground applications
unless of course we go with a predetermined songcollection such as songcollection limitedplaylist   new medialibrary songs  this stops the ability to create custom playlists
there are really a number of ways ms could address this limitation
this way we can pass the entire songcollection object to the mediaplayer play   method  and providing we don t stop the mediaplayer  the entire playlist will continue to play despite other foreground applications running
so long as the user must explicitally accept the use of teh app in the background  then why is it an issue
users understand the additional strain this would potentially put on battery life  but by accepting they agree that it s okay
these are only my suggestions  there may be smarter ways to achieve this  but in the end  the current functionallity is pointless

i can see two ways of accessing the barcode scan
from the search button as it is right now  user scans a bar code  sees the output of the search where he can tap on the icon of the decoded barcode and could be given the choice of an application who can use such information
the application would receive the decoded information and also  information about the barcode as the type etc
the other way would be to invoke the scanner from my application as for the web search
user opens my application  click a button  visual search gets opened  users scan a barcode  clicks on the thumbnail result and is redirected to my application with information on the code
is it a good idea
thank you very much  great phone
hello  thank you for this site
the application would receive the decoded information and also  information about the barcode as the    more
will significal improve advanced users experience
http   yves vg testcases ie mobi keyup event html
this is currently not really possible
i have to redirect the user to a web site which will then open the youtube app which will then play the video
after the video the user has to press back twice to get to my app
that s annoying
others are having the same problem  http   stackoverflow com questions  how to launch a youtube url on windows phone  http   stackoverflow com questions  youtube on windows phone with mediaelement
it so happens that when you type or are playing a game  a slight touch either on the back or search button takes you out of context
being unable to set up our own set of contacts to test with is incredibly frustrating  especially as the test set doesn t even cover all scenarios  none have photos  for example
unable to scroll an online video back and forth
we have installed some certificates from sbs exchange servers
some certificates was wrong
at the current release there are no possibility to see or delete the certificates  which were installed at the phone
we think  that an certificate manager would resolve the problem
i have a gel impact case and it makes it difficult to start and stop video recording
from time to time  our university also likes to submit applications which are in most of the cases not fully grown products but tech demos or prototypes
however  there is no category for publishing apps in such a category and most of the users react unintelligibly and give bad reviews as they expect a fully grown product
when i call those codes  i get answer after  minutes and i don t have an option to reply with my choise

now it is not possible to accept tcp connection  ie to build an internal web server or tcp socket server
android has it
right now app titles of more than just a dozen characters or so just get clipped in many places in the phone ui  the marketplace app list  the installed apps list  and inside of pinned tiles
im stressing out a lot when u typing something and this stpid keabord is dissapearing all the time
clicking hyperlinks  mailto  links  or dial phone numbers
rss hub synced with a new live service  like google reader  and outlook or ie sync favorites bookmarks between ie mobile  desktop and a new live service
the developer portal is for developers
there is no point in trying to fancy it up for us
i have been trying to encourage many of my friends to try making applications
they are fine with the sdk and practically making the application
that s easy
the issue they  and even i  have is trying to put it on the marketplace
the process  particularly for someone under the age of   of getting a dreamspark account  particularly now that you ve messed up that website  and an app hub account is absolutely awful
you re alienating your developers with this stuff and to be honest  it s just unacceptable

i like the functinality of the splashscreenimage jpg file  but it s too limited for what i m trying to do
sort of annoying to have to press attach three times to send three different pics
font weight in button is not working at all
i think of marketplace  voice navigation  maps  possibility to search for closest restaurant etc
zune pass
there are probably even more
in the beginning of wp users had to register a new live account and set the location to us to get access to the marketplace for example
at the moment you can only migrate to a very limited number of countries
it ll help
today apps ar silos
it would be similar to win s charms
the public contacts or the calendar
we need high performance page transition effects support
would make it possible to make calendar viewers that can behave as a real calendar alternative
currently we can create update a shelltile using a shelltiledata but can not to get shelltiledata from an existing shelltile

to be able to make a movie  and share it with the rest of the world via youtube  we need an ability to generate mpeg wmv stream file by utilizing hardware codecs  through filesink

i think there is much people who havent got credit card  and can t pay for the games
browsing on the market place every day we discover new apps  if you want to buy these ones at a later time or just want to have more time to download the app
can then redisplay the app in a special section of the market
many mobile applications are written in java
not much point opening app by voice now  if you then have to pick up phone to operate app
using category with filter to see for example all professional contact or all professional rendez vous
ie only has two search providers at the moment  with very popular search engines like google missing out
kakaotalk is a downloadable software app for mobile devices that allows its users to send and receive messages including photos  videos  and contact information both on one to one basis and in groups  all for free

current mode is focused on marketplace apps
a development mode with access granted to all api is focused for business apps
there is a bug in multicast  beginjoingroup

the event arguments from the addresschoosertask only returns the contact address as a string
so if we need a specific part of the address we d have to do some fairly tricky parsing
when entering address details for a contact the address details are split into different fields anyway so one would expect to be able to access them individually from the result an addresschoosertask as well

currently  serialization and deserialization of the cookiecontainer doesn t work
the documentation says to use the cookiecontainer if one needs to save off httponly cookies
it seems that saving the cookiecontainer isn t possible
if the server sends httponly cookies  you should create a system net cookiecontainer on the request to hold the cookies  although you will not see or be able to access the cookies that are stored in the container
microphone sampling frequency is fixed
so microphone samplerate property just returns this fixed value

it isn t useful for several intersting application
it would cost  of my votes to take  off someone elses idea

the webbrowser control performs very poorly to scrolling and html content inside rd party apps whereas the same page when opened inside the browser works fine

tombstoning and fas paradigms are non trivial to many new wp developers and error prone due to many developers not understanding it completely

all app made by edutainment u those are rubbish

option to delete all conversations at once
timer
a control which allow easy browser development rather than just loading a page like the current one
share a app like in the marketplache but in the menu
because the metro ui can not very quickly find app for lots of app shortcut
i noticed some programs are using the hardware device id for giving comfort to the user   even after reset
this is a privacy fault since i cannot delete all internet stored data connected to this id

what o o
every time a microphone recording on htc hd windows phone device is starting  a slight sound of bump is added to the recording stream
it is hard to hear since the sound of it is very low  but if the raw pcm stream is enhanced with wav headers  so that the sound is windows playable  the bump turns out to be very noticeable
the same code ran on an emulator does not results in this bump
the problem appears on both xna and audiosink recording approaches
in order to reproduce it  one should just try to record an audio on the wp device  not an emulator   have it s code add wav headers to the audio stream and save it to an isolated storage
then copy it to a windows environment to play in media player
at the beggining of an audio  a bump is heard
the problem may be relevant to htc hd only though  since i have no other device to test
in order to reproduce it  one should just try to record an audio on the    more
even if mediaplayer does not contains copyrighted media  phone recorded video   it is not possible to capture its content
when i buy a game and for any reasons i want to change my hd  for a lumia for e g
i will lost all my games i really be happy if i can download them from a virtual saving platform to my new device or for a technical problem i have to reboot my phone i would like to have those games back without download it again
this would speed up searches

microphone isheadset property now always return true even without headset connected
it seems like not a good behaviour
enable disable button for wake up on text message
creation of the hub of the programs in the list of all programs to reduce the displayed number
currently we only have the choice of hearing the voice notification in headset when the ring vibrate is selected which also ring the phone
like the dashboard update twist control from the xbox

i came from android world  where i really liked the google map integration with turn by turn navigation
where  any address can be opened in google map  then get direction  and launch the navigation from the same screen
in which it will pick up the address from the map and gets the turn by turn voice direction and it works like a charm
just like windows
the wp   os is great
but it lacks the capability to increase volume of the device or costomize live tiles or backround
one thing the people want is to make there device there own
app that will allow to do all this to there live tiles  backround and to the volume
we will be happy
and ms will beat all the other plat forms

toast message seem to be localizable only serversided
that has at least  disadvantages   more work to do for programmers  always check if user has changed the language and notify the webservice so it can change toast messages  if user changes language and dont start app  there is no way of notifying the webservice that is has changed  so user will get wrong language toasts   change it to a localizable mechanism please

according to the description the pushpin object should work as pop up information window activated by pressing the map icon
now it doesn t work the same way
this combined with file drag drop from windows explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler
today  when users click a link in ie  most of the times you would get a message that this content type is not supported on phone
altough there are app like office  acrobet reader and many rd party apps which handles the particular content type
today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user
since the screen times out after option has the maximum time for only  minute and as a consumer perspective it s okay  but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the visual studio shows the message like  the application could not be launched for debugging
like other platforms are having the option for usb debugging
the same could be implemented in the windows phone so that developer can use it hassle free
a general use case is that i m working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now i stopped debugging and now i started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the device get locked and again if i debug the app then the same error popups
thanks since the screen times out after option has the maximum time for only  minute and as a consumer perspective it s okay  but for a developer this feature is very annoying when we debug our apps on the device and the visual studio shows the message like  the application could not be launched for debugging

developers wishing to leverage the zune media platform to offer improved or tailored podcast playback experiences are currently blocked
instead  an app developer must re implement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the pc zune software
once access to a user   s podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled  developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience
this idea could be relatively simply achieved as a new podcast genre  however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a user   s genres are musical  other than the ringtone genre
a better implementation might expose a new property or method on medialibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object

you are running an application that records your gps position after traveling so many feet
if for some reason your application gets deactivated  you receive a phone call   your recorded track will be missing data for the time you were on the phone

what this forces the user to do is carry a hand held gps as well as a phone when the track log is important

ssdp  used in upnp  relies on udp multicast for discovery
currently udpanysourcemulticastclient allows for the listening to existing ssdp traffic  as well as sending a solicitation  m search  out requesting that upnp devices advertise themselves to the solicitor

texture coordinate transforms are not exposed for any effects that can be used by the reach profile even though this is something the gpu can probably do cheaply
a developer should be able to grant access to another app for data access

i started as a sole developer  and now there s a group of us  and we are registered as a business with irs
it is a common scenario in the real world  so why should it be impossible in the marketplace
to enter just numbers  with no additional simbols but      and
business apps usually have that kind of needs
so  i had this great idea for an app    got a good chunk of it coded  then found out that smscomposetask doesn t have the ability to attach images as an mms
is this coming in a future release
ideally  emailcomposetask would get it as well
focus         mango         bug

there s one area where mango is a retrograde step when compared with nodo   theme support
in nodo the user could leave the app switch the theme  i e
dark or light    return to the app which would now  in theory  respect their selection
in mango the user s faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system s theme state at start up
developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme   sticking to it  thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless
the smscomposetask does not provide any events

i thought i had raised this as a platform request  but seems it s showing up in feature feedback instead
multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how  or be told how  to do it  however it s not very intuitive and i m concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be
current capability for multiline navigation via textbox                                                                      the way it currently works is if you tap and hold  you get the i cursor to appear
if you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the textbox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the textbox
however  if you entered shorter lines  you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the i cursor makes contact with some text
you will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens
i believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half  allowing for the sip  a portrait or landscape screen
what would improve usability
swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto visible  latter is currently ignored
alternatively                  to provide an experience consistent with the platforms sms text input capability  provide support to allow textbox to   grow as new lines are added
be placed in a scrollviewer and have the viewport follow newlines as they are added
thanks for considering

there is currently no way to know if an emailcomposetask was cancelled or got an error while sending
otherwise i have to ask the user if they sent it  poor user experience
like cacert org for instance
it should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily
think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something
currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after  days if the application is not opened
app specific launchers  instead of opening a site s web page  check whether a compatible app is installed or registered
ux is much better and
to support things like midroll video advertisments  multiple mediaelements are needed
this is supported in silverlight for the web
it would be helpfull to have a passwordbox like control which supports number only keyboard
numeric only passwords makes more sense for smartphone world as its fast  convenient and easy to type
private corporate wifi authentication with a certificate is not supported at mango
this could allow for quite a few scenarios   someone is currently locked in with a carrier that doesn t have wp phones available
they could actually purchase apps on the marketplace and use them
enable a code once and runs on windows or phone
the reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters  add audio tracks  crop out a relevant section  etc    of a recorded video and saving it back to the medialibrary
i assume saving to the medialibrary will be part of the ar functionality in mango anyway
this will benefit for applications which create audio  or recording voice  it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program
using touch to position the cursor is a good start  but it s clumsy and easily off by one character  which would be acceptable if there were at least a left arrow key in addition to backspace
perhaps at least press hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu
besides myself  is there any interest in adding this capability
i request that the multiscaleimage library to be able to access isolated storage
there are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower  e g
in a general aviation  or commercial  aircraft where cell phones do not work well  it is illegal to use in any case  and also in isolated rural areas
also  why pay data charges to view the same image over and over  aren   t music   photo libraries stored on phones
and finally memory is very cheap
some suggest that large images  even broken into tiles  are inappropriate for storage on a phone     that is ridiculous
if a user wants an application to host content  whether it be gb of music or gb of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative
if a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online   none
some suggest that large images  even broken into tiles  are inappropriate for storage on a phone     that    more
the implementation of the sql compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the  net gui implementation that made it very easy to use

somebody correct me if i m way off base
please let me know how to do this
both on my ios and droid i can use my work email exchange server
however the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those oses

ability to display street side and birds eye view from bing map control
when you update an app and update the app tile icon and or background image  save the update as it is not working
imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call  the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him her
this is a missing feature since windows mobile
do you agree that it is time to have it now
it was great to see at a glance rating  money generated by the application
currently in mango these is a soft search button in the gui displayed for context sensitive search
the hardware button seems to always pull up a bing
surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive
this would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway
in order to display more details on network connection  and to distinguish wifi networks connected to
i notice it is already available to the user in the   version  mango  but i don t see methods in the api for scanning to the next signal  or seeking  whatever the term is called
back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal  just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden
handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users can t download your app and instantly think the app is useless
in the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store or if exist  it is really well hidden
in addiction if you try delete an app name  you can also confirm your operation but the name doesn t get deleted and stay reserved for the app
i can t see the total downloads of my apps anymore  because the downloads prior to the new dashboard has vanished
currently we need to do some trickery to take screenshots of application that use panorama control
we can access exif info  limited  using a picture object when dealing with media library
but if we try to save an image within app inside media library or some isolated storage we can t prserve exif info of that image
read the given link for more details  http   forums create msdn com forums p   aspx
when you use the defaultitem property of the panorama control  it s as if you re just rearranging the items
i use this property to restore application state after tombstoning  but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves
the correct behavior would be if the panorama were to immediately scroll to the default page  whether animated or not
the old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that i no longer want to be published
i can t do this in the new developer center for apps that have passed certification and are published in the store
the keywords people use in unsuccessful marketplace searches  particularly in the desktop zune application  would  if ranked by frequency  provide useful information to developers on where to focus their development efforts
this would create more opportunities for developers while also helping to provide customers with the apps they want
needed to create pro level sequencers  synths and music creation related apps
if i want to update a live tile from my own app i can t draw it s background image on the phone  because if i store it to isolatedstorage i m not able to get an uri for it which i could provide the standardtiledata object with
if there were an extras menu option in ie where rd party apps could be plugged in  it would be possible to pass perhaps the url of the currently selected site onto apps that could add value   for instance  by giving the option to subscribe to an rss or atom feed where present
when developing with the phone connected via usb  having the screen lock itself is very annoying  and makes app deployment fail
some wp phone  not the at t samsung focus  have a never screen timeout
however this is for battery and powered scenarios  and you don t want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time

with the windows phone store it was possible to have a beta version of the app with windows apps  it was not  and nobody ever got why
do not complain if developers prefer other platforms  you don t make us life easy at all
currently you can assign to applicationbariconbutton an icon present on your project as  content
this basically means you have to determine your icons at design time
by providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the isolatedstorage  the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime  dynamically download them from other places etc
there is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard
i don t believe that there is not ado net

some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason
they may have been in a country that is not supported for example
more then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting
some people may sell their apps to others
in all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one
when i create a paid app with a trial option  many users blow right by it because it doesn t show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free  via the trial
some people are resorting to the super inefficient apple app store method of releasing  versions of the app    one that shows up in the free category and another that runs as a paid app
the trial is a fantastic concept  but it is hobbled by this oversight
right now there is no way to sync anything but pictures generated on the phone to the user s pc

updating an app listing that supports multiple languages is one of the most painful experiences when developing for windows
which will be detected when we upload the app via the dashboard

it would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports   news hub

also something for sms
this is for perform any action on background
sometimes it s usefull to explore and tranfer back files generated in app that s running on phone emulator back to the developer pc  without additional coding
obviously this is in place to ensure people do not spend lots of money if they don t have unlimited bundles
however a simple message box saying this message is going to be sent to  people  are you sure you want to send would be sufficient
this system for featuresuggestion is good  but i miss the feedback to the feedback
at the moment only one idea is marked as planed
even some of the ideas will ship in the next update they haven t marked as planed or startet

the company for i works loose a project because one of the client s requirements is change the windows wallpaper  ringtones and other features that are no disponible in windows phone

currently it is very tedious and takes hours to submit an app update  especially when you have multiple app packages  and lots of languages
you have to manually use the website to change descriptions  switch languages  lots of copy and paste  remove each screenshot  put a new screenshot
it literally takes hours  and it drives you crazy
instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly
currently apps are executed in sandboxes and there s no way to apps can work together
one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes
the same is true for applications and the os itself

google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading of ebooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading of ebooks but none of theme have inbuilt dictionary and they lack in many features in terms of user experience
i understand the max size limitation to control
and there are some approach to work around on most of the controls
however  for some control  e g
textbox  it s a big problem
socket apis and duplex wcf communication
currently it s not possoble to make connections behind proxy servers that require authentication
this very much limits business type apps that can use resources or run apps while connected to a work network
it s only currently possible via the web browser
this would make bug fixes to spelling and screeshots simple   would save microsoft from having to test submissions for metadata only
maybe sending a zip
system supported application error reporting service  that would report back to developers application crashes and details
this enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info
this enables caching of and usage of offline maps
until windows  phone    this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work
hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots
then  i navigate to another page  press the button and it take n screenshots again  one for each language
in the upload website  a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once
so developpers can have more confidence it will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting to the marketplace
time saver for developers and microsoft
the phone currently plays a large selection of media formats  mp  mv  gp etc  that aren t supported in the emulator
this makes apps that use these formats extremely hard to debug
would be awesome if you could fix this
just like the picture music extras to be able to integrate in a persons phone numbers unkown caller   so to add phone services to easy search for numbers or to be able to start a contact message app from the contact card
register as a launcher chooser  to ease on device inter application communication

currently only store apps can be submitted to the store
with all the new screen sizes and resolutions  testing in the emulator is certainly one way to try them out  but it d aid in even more rapid development to be able to see them on the design surface like we already have for wvga  wxga  and p sizes
we re still missing the p and  sizes
currently if we logged in twitter fb or any other social networking sites throug their apis  we cant logout
it is because the web browser keeps the cookies
so he cant login into his another account
currently  windows phone    if you store your credentials in the passwordvault  they aren t deleted on app uninstall  so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available
i think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall
creating a modern windows app can require creating a lot of project files  one one per platform type  windows phone    windows phone    windows    and windows     with each project generating its own  unique output
even universal app projects create multiple projects  one for windows    another for windows phone    neither of which support the previous    versions of windows  to note
on ios  it s possible to target many versions of the os                 etc
with a single project file
when the app gets built  it generates a single package that can be distributed to any version of the os  within developer set version limitations
when a new version of the os comes out  it s possible to upgrade the app s project  and still have it s output support older versions of the os
windows   projects  when updated to windows   projects  lose their ability to support windows
being able to target multiple versions of windows with a single project  one that  preferably  built a single app package  would be useful
furthermore  upgrading that project to target the latest version of windows  shouldn t cause support for the previous version  of the os  to be lost
ios developers get this feature  so should windows developers
when the app gets built  it generates a single package that can be    more

some svg files may be dynamically generated by a remote server   svg data loaded in a xaml view may have internal named elements
i would imagine that there    d be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers  hover touch  etc   change properties  color  opacity  etc
we used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in xaml   there    s a lot of free source svg files that usable under creative commons on wikipedia for things like us maps  electoral districts and many other rich features
o it    s a huge time saver to piggyback on those assets
for example  suppose you wanted to color a us map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way
this is easily done with some reference data   svg from wikipedia
a designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that xaml
that xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and can    t be a separate file resource  can it
the high level ask is to support using svg within a xaml tree
the svg data may be inline or loaded from a source  local file or remote from the web  there are few current tools for converting svg to wpf silverlight based xaml but they fall short when dealing with more complex svg data
here are a few scenarios    apps loading svg content from a remote web server
this should work just like any other kind of image data

without that  we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator
the older tooling  appdeploycmd exe  would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them  though it s support for devices left a lot to be desired
oddly with windows   tooling installed and windows  sdk  we can actually see the list of windows  emulators listed in the appdeploycmd output  and need to do some post filtering to separate the   and  emulators
so currently  we can use the   tooling to get the list of emulators  but if we try to deploy to them they ll start up but app deployment will fail
in doing some testing  it appears winappdeploycmd  may  work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the
x x ip address of the emulator   but i can find no way to get that programmatically either
i tried powershell scripts using wmi such as http   www ravichaganti com blog get hyper v windows server  guest network configuration using wmi    see https   social msdn microsoft com forums en us ceadc a c e baebe uwp how to programmatically deploy appx to win  mobile emulator forum wpdevelop there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows  emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio
we also have no entries listed for windows  emulators  running or not  in the  devices  output
the biggest issue ask is to deploy an app to an emulator via that command line tool  in much the same way the appdeploycmd worked for
without that  we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator

in my view  the two main use cases for the store search can be summarised as follows

as a windows app consumer  i want to be able to search for apps by name  so that i can find and download the specific app i am looking for
an example of the first might be        i    ve heard that wordament is good  so i    ll type       wordament     into the search box so i can download and play it during my commute to work
an example of the second might be        i really enjoy doing crossword puzzles  so i    ll type       crosswords     into the search box so that i can find and download a crossword app that i play during my commute to work
the store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords
it would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two
in my view  and i can see from the forums and user voice channel that i am not alone in this  the store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two
intuitively  if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular  and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name
in addition  app names are quite specific and so searches for  facebook  and  wordament  should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as  crosswords
conversely  new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers  and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two

the textbox control is the most used control in a windows program
it also cause a lot of problem either from qa or the user because of invalid data that was entered
using a masked control will save a lot of time for the developer and reduce the complaints and bugs
now with win dashboard the stack trace only provide a snippet of the error which is included in the error lines
however with the new dashboard this is the only information that is provided on the dashboard

we understand your concerns about your app experience with the search results
your app is published and can be found here
right now we can t show progress on the taskbar for example to let a user see the current status of a download or something else
media player buttons are possible in the taskbar but why not the progressbar
weekly or daily email report  as provided by other app tracking platforms  with summary of downloads  reviews and other metrics
currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using scheduledtoastnotification

typeconverter is helpful because it allows the author of a type to provide intrinsic support for determining to from which types a type may be converted and actually converting between types   most typically for converting to from string but other types as well
these users are now required to buy the app again to own the app
speculation  it appears to me that the store is seeing the update as a new app and therefore the original certificate is no longer recognized    thereby triggering the symptoms above
the issue gets complicated when the users owned the app via a free promo and support may not be willing to restore the purchase using this method
feel free to contact me if further info is required
thank you
microsoft support recommended me to post the issue here
there s a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed
the problem starts after a certain app update
the symptoms are as stated in the title
certain users who had installed the app prior to the problematic update are affected
fresh users are not affected by this issue

there are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete remove apps and iaps from their dev center

do you think it can work this way
these feedbacks were all refused  and i can imagine the motivation behind this  so i try to formulate better what s really the point is on this  if a developer has many unpublished apps or iaps their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not  more  relevant data regarding to app that there aren t no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now
so i think you should      more
it is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is nt show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by name

inexplicably  the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly  years ago


and with the variablesizedwrapgrid you must hardwire the column span and row span of each item to ensure everything fits
one simple example where the wrappanel is essential is when displaying a       tag cloud
the wrapgrid makes it possible to display a fully adaptable ui since as the container gets narrower on small screens everything can still be seen
but it is not just for tag clouds
the wrappanel behavior is how items flow in html
it is astounding to me that such a useful ui control        one that microsoft built years ago and with behavior that powers nearly every html page in existence        was left out of the uwp
inexplicably  the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly  years ago
this panel is similar to a stackpanel but if there are too many items to fit in a row the subsequent items are displayed in the next row down
there are other panels in the uwp that do something similar  like the wrapgrid  but this doesn    t work well if the items are variable size

when an error occurs it happens a lot that exception stacktrace is null  in the app unhandledexception handler for instance
this is in fact documented and the offical recommendation is to try catch closer to the code  https   msdn microsoft com en us library windows apps windows ui xaml application unhandledexception
the problem is we can t put try catch everywhere and we would like to understand crashes but without a stacktrace it is difficult
