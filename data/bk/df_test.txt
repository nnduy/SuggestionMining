__label__0 to enter just numbers, with no additional simbols but +, - and .
__label__0 Some especially for mobile useful CSS features like ms-scroll-chaining, snap-points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie10, which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries.
__label__0 Windows Phone Support team can simply refuse further communication and everything stops there.
__label__0 However, if an IT tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms, the enrollment experience is then totally different.
__label__0 I'm searching for a way to send an sms to a sms-service number, end then handle the received sms with reply information to the sent sms.
__label__0 I had decided to buy a WP8 phone, but aslong as the calendar lacks so many functions, and there is no hope of a better 3rd party app, I will stick with iOS or possibly Android.
__label__1 The general concept of a ResourceIntensiveTask being launched when constraints are met is strong but the implementation could be greatly improved.
__label__0 If we have a form in a scrollviewer and a textbox recieves focus then the page translates.Instead of that the page size should become smaller and the user shouldbe able to scroll all the fields even when the page is open.

This can be seen in settings page.

Start typing something in the search tab and try to scroll to the bottom most element while the inputpane is open, you cant see the last element.
__label__0 The benefit of this idea would be that I often find that having opened an application, I would like to have it easily available to use again.
__label__0 If so me thinks this is a fundamental flaw in the OS!
__label__1 Windows should allow additional user accounts added to track & review the application review process similar to what Apple and Android apple stores allow.

__label__0 CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user-friendly.
__label__1 I believe HTC Blinkfeed is getting a lot of users as well, and it'll be nice if you guys can reach out to HTC to get your APIs working with their Blinkfeed :) 
__label__0 A lot of small time developers like myself don't have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps.
__label__0 This combined with file drag drop from Windows Explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler.
__label__1 Please bring the DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly method in Universal Apps just like in WPF.
__label__0 As of now it's only possible to set the CalenderIdentifier property to tell the control which calender to use.
__label__0 But the problem is the App name automatically reserved to the Tab version, and the package name also.
__label__0 If it is not intended why then is it not called Windows CRT for Microsoft VC - what am I missing and is it really legal/appropriate?
__label__0 A store app uses BackgroundDownloader download a FTP URI.

After the first successful download, BackgroundDownloader caches the resulting file.Regardless of whether the FTP server is online or the file is updated, downloaded again will be successful to get a cache file.
__label__0 This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections.
__label__0 what I think cool is getting the LatLong points of visible map layer allowing me to place any useful information on the sides or corner.

__label__0 Thank you very much, great phone !
__label__0 This eats up screen real estate and impacts load times.
__label__0 It was also nice to see your 'badges' of honor... in one place {: Another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom - showing related apps - as long as they meet a certain review standard - to promote cross visibility.
__label__0 I can still login with iexplore.
__label__1 I think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps don't fall into any specific section already listed.
__label__0 Many developer will be bringing java / python / etc applications to the Windows Store via the Desktop Bridge.
__label__0 That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code:
__label__0 But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface.
__label__1 I would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories, but I don't want to see them anymore in Feedly after this action is executed.

__label__1 Since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the Fluent Design System I think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other Composition APIs to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment.

__label__0 :) Sir/Ma'am some uses have buy Windows Phone 7 only then because they was thinking that in Windows Phone 7 they can access system files and can be able to modify their Windows Phone 7 according to their need and as they want, But you break our heart :( You can think that if Windows Phone 7 will be fully unlock then some users can illegally copy applications from one Windows Phone 7 to another Windows Phone 7.

__label__0 After installing the OS, installing my Apps, installing MS Office, Norton, and other desktop apps.
__label__0 Hello I am new to the forum so I apologize if this is not in the incorrect area to post this.

__label__0 OpenXML SDK Office for WinRT __ Office Primary Interop Assembly Classes for WinRT Win8 applications need to be more productive for businesses!

__label__0 First of all, I love feedly.	
__label__0 2) Mute option does not work smoothly.
__label__0 Aplicaci__n oficial de Telegram (que existe en Android) para Windows Phone ya que es una app que se esta comenzando a utilizar mucho.
__label__0 I subscribe to my YouTube subscriptions in Feedly and so much appreciate this feature.
__label__0 (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070003)
__label__1 And also it will be great the Microsoft expands it services internationally like for example Cortana which it barely works in regions outside the US.
__label__1 I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now.
__label__0 To give you some context why this matters to us our app is a video streaming app with both VoD and live TV content.
__label__1 The only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in XAML (not just controls but other types too), in the same namespace, creating a very ugly unwieldy API to code against.
__label__0 My votes show up on items I didn't Vote for and the only item (up til now) I submitted doesn't show up under my feedback.
__label__1 Developers need create/edit document from Windows Store Apps.

__label__1 I really want the Universal Apps to grow more powerful.
__label__0 So it could stick with the same 4 row limit but could allow for wrapping so if there were 7 items, the applicationbar would expand to allow for the 2nd row of icons.
__label__1 There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete/remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center.
__label__0 Why do you always have to make a developer's life difficult.
__label__0 I liked Windows 10 Version 1803.
__label__0 where, any address can be opened in google map, then get direction, and launch the navigation from the same screen.
__label__1 We like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of Microsoft (or anyone but us for that matter) is KEY.
__label__0 Best regards Stefano Montimoregi I developed the app bizview, a Google Analytics client with the same features of Official Google Analytics app in the Android Store.
__label__0 After this the control is no more usable the only option is to close the application and reload all.

__label__0 In Windows 10 Mobile, any third-party app can act as a Caller-ID app to intercept the call and set the PhoneCallOrigin.

But other apps cannot access PhoneCallOrigin from PhoneCallHistoryEntry.
__label__0 A lot of official apps are almost completely abandoned (like Istragram Beta), but some unofficial clients are really amazing.
__label__0 Tombstoning and FAS paradigms are non-trivial to many new WP7 developers and error prone due to many developers not understanding it completely.
__label__1 So it would be nice to create controls to achieve Microsoft's vision easily.
__label__0 When developing with the phone connected via USB, having the screen lock itself is very annoying, and makes app deployment fail.
__label__0 opens up further possibilities around subscription, paid-only content, contributors influencing content creators, etc.
__label__0 That's ridiculous and I'm sick and tired of finding the way.
__label__0 Android 4.1, Feedly 19.1, Chrome.
__label__0 Ways this could potentially be fixed:
__label__0 I'm currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.
__label__0 Silverlight and Windows Phone does not support that right now.
__label__0 If it's a hardware problem, then I'm going___ more
__label__0 Other user's who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for IT teams to support more than one browser.
__label__0 Everytime I open a UWP app both Xpadder and the app recognize input thus doubling the signal.
__label__0 I hope this helps!
__label__0 Silverlight for WindowsPhone provides basic, built-in binding validation through the Binding.ValidatesOnExceptions property, as documented in the Silverlight Data Binding topic.
__label__0 My questions: Why it is not included as built-in?
__label__1 Please, make update!
__label__1 when users click on APP they should directly see UI no lags.
__label__0 When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.
__label__0 So many things to do compared to just drag and drop.
__label__1 Please make it available .. As it also makes the Zune tile live

__label__0 What this forces the user to do is carry a hand-held GPS as well as a phone when the track log is important.
__label__1 Would be nice to make split view behave the way Surface home screen behaves OOB.
__label__0 The name of our software is J&L Financial Planner.
__label__0 It's AFAIK impossible to create an app that opens as soon as it's tapped.
__label__0 I am not going to download multiple GBs of **** that I will never use to fix a memory leak.
__label__1 Popular forums, like Kuenna for Joomla and stand alone forums should be allowed.
__label__0 For sure it resets them every reboot.
__label__1 The SwipeControl control should support mouse input as well as touch input.
__label__0 Please guys make it happen!
__label__0 Like a Send to tumblr button, and liking posts from tumblr feeds.
__label__0 This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items.
__label__0 Would battery experience really degrade that much?
__label__1 It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one.
__label__0 Could it be that when I leave home and phone switches to 4G, the switch causes apps to close?
__label__0 It seems like there's now some sort of internal limit on how many MapIcons are displayed at a time.
__label__1 Take any XAML page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model.
__label__0 Also, why pay data charges to view the same image over and over [aren___t music & photo libraries stored on phones?]
__label__0 Secondly, we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers.
__label__0 I've tried this sample but not a luck.
__label__0 It's very usefull when you want to make application with, for example , voice or image processing
__label__0 Not individual articles, list as a whole.
__label__0 see for example http://www.newsgeek.co.il/quite-in-the-train/ or any other Hebrew WP site.
__label__1 want to still be able to subscribe to Twitter feeds without having to create Twitter account

__label__0 I got the _hWnd from CoreIndependentInputSource.Dispacher using the VS debug inspector and then called TryDisableWindowsVisualFeedback() as seen here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27550373/disable-touch-visual-feedback-on-windows-8-1-programmatically-desktop-app
__label__0 There all still to much bugs on current main apps.
__label__1 I feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service that's already up and running like SendtoReader.com OR I would gladly pay $$$ to have the option for Feedly to do it on it's own and send to my kindle.
__label__0 What can i do?
__label__1 Support the Windows.Media.Editing API on Windows 8.
__label__0 and ms will beat all the other plat forms.

__label__0 However now I'm stuck using DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_SNORM
__label__0 that made all document viewing/editing APP has a terrible user experience.
__label__0 The following page https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/ does not work in IE.
__label__1 The idea is to segregate the User Interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser/chrome as a standalone application.
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction.
__label__1 In addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on Windows 10 Mobile any time you want via device portal.
__label__0 Thanks for considering changing this.
__label__0 usually I end up opening the link in feedly, wait for the site to load, and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome.

__label__1 I would like Microsoft to open up this framework to all developers.

__label__1 So I think you should add some hide some option to not only unpublish app but eventually logically remove their entries from the dashboard (main app list, graphs, etc.) You can eventually add a page where all the apps/IAPs hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them to the dashboard in case he changes his mind.

__label__0 From http://moderncpp.com/ Modern is a Standard C++ language projection for the Windows Runtime.
__label__0 We end up writing lot of custom Styles in XAML for Split view.
__label__0 Choose to login automatically with your microsoft account saved into phone (also win8/RT) without insert login and password again.
__label__0 Why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever.
__label__1 Provide an option to keep a Keep-alive connection in background so that we can create IM
__label__0 Once in the article, whether within feedly or in safari I would press the back button top left.
__label__0 This would be HUGE.
__label__0 Even my old phone Nokia E71 running on Symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked.
__label__0 I have been experiencing tons of system crashes recently so I disabling my third-party loopback driver to see if it helps but this means I lose this functionality.
__label__1 As such, please make the installation of the SDK optional during the SDK installation.
__label__0 Adding this API would make room for 3rd-party messaging apps and phone management apps.
__label__1 Please add a delegate version for the PropertyMetadata.Create where the DependencyProperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value.
__label__0 We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.
__label__0 Still not supporting Windows 7?
__label__1 My idea to add a feature of ... apps to be given permission by the user to run in background whenever required prompting the user that enabling an app to run in background may cause battery drainage...
__label__0 In Dev Center I can see the downloads for only up to 6 apps at once.
__label__0 I have a driver causing a memory leak.

__label__0 http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/6080912-we-want-open-the-app-by-tap-the-quick-status-icon
__label__0 Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles).
__label__0 As a web developer, I do not like plugins that add elements to the DOM of each page.	
__label__0 uwp Media Element or MediaPlayerElement are fantastic with UI.But their codecs to play different kinds of audio and video files is very limited.
__label__0 The last three days I was working hard to solve a problem submitting our UWP app to the store.
__label__0 I liked the previous Dev Center where I could compare multiple apps on the same graph and just the look in general.
__label__0 I could only control the device with a keyboard plugged in to the USB port.
__label__0 The following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine:
__label__0 So here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this API change would help to improve the code flow: var clientCert; ensureCertficatesAsync = function() { logger.trace(Checking client certificate); if (clientCert) { logger.info(Using already loaded client certificate); return WinJS.Promise.as(clientCert); } var certQuery = new Certificates.CertificateQuery(); certQuery.friendlyName = Client Cert; return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery).then(function(certs) { if (!certs.length) { return Windows.Storage.StorageFile.getFileFromApplicationUriAsync(ms-appx:///cert/client.pfx); }).then(Windows.Storage.FileIO.readBufferAsync).then(function(buffer) { var pfx = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.encodeToBase64String(buffer); logger.info(Installing client certificate); return Certificates.CertificateEnrollmentManager.importPfxDataAsync( pfx, XXXXX, Certificates.ExportOption.notExportable, Certificates.KeyProtectionLevel.noConsent, Certificates.InstallOptions.none, certQuery.friendlyName ); }).then(function() { // This search in the store could be omitted logger.info(Client certificate installed); return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery); }).then(function(certs) { return clientCert = certs[0]; }); } else { logger.info(Client certificate already installed); return clientCert = certs[0]; } }); } As you can see after installing the pfx I have to query the store again to fetch the pfx to use it in calls to HttpClient with a filter.
__label__0 In my application that plays MP3's over the internet often when I start a track it stops playing after some time for a second or so and then continues normally.
__label__0 Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP)
__label__0 Please note yalla apps in dubai provides way to submit apps to marketplace but it is too costly for developers which takes 50% commission from total income of developers and provides only one device unlock for free .
__label__0 This method can be called multiple times for the same header.
__label__0 And it's not because they are colliding with other MapIcons.
__label__1 Also I think NuGut should maintain User Comments for each package...and a 4 star rating...so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing....
__label__1 Currently Windows OS decides the best Internet connection and uses it automatically (If I have more than one connection like WiFi and Network cable).

Need user setting option to override the same and assign one or more app to use specific network connection (WiFi) and others to use other possible network connection (3g/4g).

This way the already paid for (3g/4g, WiFi, Network cable, etc.) or for that matter I can take more than one provider's internet with variable speeds at home and connect to one PC and use it optimally/efficiently.
__label__0 It would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports & news hub.
__label__0 Maybe sending a zip.
__label__0 We also have no entries listed for Windows 10 emulators (running or not) in the 'devices' output.
__label__0 Then you chose with one to open.
__label__0 This screws up my group metrics (e.g. count) and makes it annoying when sending out email blasts (commercial providers use recipients as a metric for billing).
__label__1 When you have a text editor, with unsaved changes, the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing.

This is not possible on UWP.

Please add option to do that on UWP desktop apps.
__label__1 This property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario.
__label__1 Would also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.
__label__0 This leads the user to have to type AGAIN the whole description.
__label__0 I do not know what else to do.
__label__0 (A full native implementation would address the performance side of things, but I can't justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform.
__label__0 Example: Create a reminder that starts today, ends in month, and reminds the user every Tue.
__label__0 On the field there are hundreds of CAD industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a 3D mouse on the remote server over Microsoft RDC.

__label__0 This was a braking change since the old Windows Phone Store did not have this kind of limitation.
__label__1 Allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest, perhaps via custom certificate, like Microsoft Office Digital Certificate for VBA Projects.
__label__0 Some especially for mobile useful CSS features like ms-scroll-chaining, snap-points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie10, which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries.
__label__0 The idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest, OR the app can ASK FOR TRUST so if the user agrees the app will be shown in the trusted app center in the settings with its extra permissions requested.
__label__0 The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.
__label__0 The skeleton tracking is not working on XBOX.
__label__0 I started the windows phone 8.1 emulator with the following configuration for testing purpose: UI Language: German, Region: US, Format Settings: Irish.
__label__0 I get no results when I try plugging _services._dns-sd._udp.
__label__0 Feedly to Google plus causes the Feedly app to crash back to the home screen on Kindle Fire.

__label__1 Allow chatting in threads with google talk, similar to how facebook chat is implemented in threads.
__label__1 I would like to be able to convert my individual account in the Marketplace into a company one without losing my publisher name, my brand, my app portfolio and my user base.
__label__0 This is a problem when credit cards constantly fail authorization.
__label__0 (sorry if my English is bad, that's a foreign language for me, I'm French)
__label__0 I hardly understand why Store App Dev center requires Azure AD account for adding managers.
__label__0 Sure we could replace the status bar with our own UI containing the same info.
__label__0 However if I then click on sharing and google plus, it opens in safari.
__label__0 Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this?
__label__0 On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.
__label__0 The application would receive the decoded information and also, information about the barcode as the___ more
__label__0 This restriction does not exist on Linux and MacOS.
__label__0 All contacts had the same ringtone.
__label__1 In an ideal world I should be able to invoke a task and than optionally send it somewhere else for continuation or just forget about it.
__label__0 It also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches.
__label__0 I’m using the property DeviceInformation::Name in my application to display the port name.
__label__0 On the other hand, if my goal is as much common code___ more
__label__0 it's extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not.
__label__1 Allow us to query device information from a 100% native C++ application so we are not forced to use C#.
__label__0 The best of the best would be to have a DrawingContext on the MapControl :-) with DrawLine etc..
__label__1 Adding an image editor to CaptureElement control with these options: - Ability to save captured image as predefined image types (.jpg .png...etc).
__label__0 But in windows every time we hav to open contact and search name.. Ex.
__label__0 I have an app that works normally but when launched via the Desktop Bridge there's some strange issues with COM.
__label__0 You can write your own converter for System.Uri to an image source type but then you have to manually specify the converter on each binding plus you lose any (performance) tweaks MS may have made in their own converter.
__label__0 In 2017 .NET Native is still not mature and still has bugs.
__label__0 MapRoute constructor should accept IRoutePath inteface instead of Route class.
__label__1 There It would be better if we havent have to upgrage software via zune.It is timefull and useless.There should be delta upgrades OTA
__label__0 Could someone answer my question please?
__label__1 I would be convinient if the copyAndReplaceAsync method would return something similar to the copyAsync method.
__label__0 Every time I restart Chrome feedly mini appears on every web page.
__label__0 Windows Phone breaks from iOS and Android by removing the need to open an app to share pictures and statuses by adding a sharing API.
__label__0 Right now we can't show progress on the taskbar for example to let a user see the current status of a download or something else.

__label__1 I currently use NewsBlur, but I'd love to transfer all my feeds via OPML to Feedly.
__label__0 Now on Windows Phone 8 when we have 3 resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time.
__label__0 Even if this API would use a webservice and needs network access, I would be fine with that.
__label__0 Each time I sit down the display setting for the external screen is to clone but I want it to be extended.
__label__1 It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one-way binding.
__label__1 Put back all games in games folder
__label__0 Another win is that - right now, I have to generate my multi-factor authentication code when I try to login to Feedly on my iPad which is not always convenient -- for Feed reading purposes.
__label__0 there is apps in android phone that is appslock, same apps should be in windows phone
__label__0 When a corporate customer tries to submit app, an error message Your account doesn't have permission to submit apps to the Store displays and they cannot submit any app.

I know that this message means when Symantec vetting is triggered, but this message is vague and doesn't mention what user needs to do.
__label__0 UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions.
__label__0 we think, that an certificate manager would resolve the problem.
__label__0 Currently the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter into account.
__label__1 I *should* be able to use feedly in luakit.
__label__0 I know that this message means when Symantec vetting is triggered, but this message is vague and doesn't mention what user needs to do.

__label__0 There is no actual error and submission completes.
__label__0 they dont want to see my reply, nor do i want them to.
__label__0 When I'm accessing this API, I get 1'200 for fullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours and 1'300 for designCapacityInMilliwattHours.
__label__1 Furthermore Age Ratings in Dev Center Dashboard can be set per app according to the content in the app.
__label__0 When using Feedly on a mobile device, location information becomes available to the app as well.
__label__0 i can use it to recover my files.
__label__0 lets keep the automatic adjustment of screen brightness with manual compensation that increases or decreases the value automatically set

__label__0 3.- WCF don't let duplex communication.
__label__0 Youtube video work fine on feedly but somehow vimeo video is not showing the content instead showing error #2048.

__label__0 To give you some context why this matters to us our app is a video streaming app with both VoD and live TV content.
__label__0 I have a tester who failed my game multiple times, and a supervisor who backed him up, but both are dead wrong as seen from reading their own failure report.
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.
__label__0 Are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the Toolbox alongside the OS based standard controls?
__label__1 In my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control.
__label__0 the current search in Office only works on titles of OneNote docs, but not their content.. which is not very useful!
__label__1 Should also do this for other converters for same behavior.
__label__0 For this cost, a company would receive two unlocked WindowsPhone devices that could be traded or upgraded.
__label__1 AUTOSHAPE.

There should a window in which user can connect .... (Dots) and make his own auto shape.

If the auto shape has curve then more .... dots with less space between them should be given to Join.

Based on connected Dots, windows should suggest AUTOSHAPES related to that.

__label__0 - I don't know if it is only me but I can't… more

__label__0 Our app requires to call a web service from the Application_Deactivated/Application_Closing event to generate an analytics report.
__label__0 I absolutely love the Windows Store implementation.
__label__1 Add the ability to connect to WindowsShare/Samba servers.
__label__0 It is used a lot, almost as much as the comma and full stop.
__label__0 The automated script leaves a 5 star review and asks that you do the same for their app.
__label__1 Also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug.
__label__0 But we (developers) can afford them and we can get a lot of benefits from this kind of apps.
__label__1 There should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review.
__label__1 (Compare the UI usage with Google Chrome for example.)
__label__0 Before our users find them.

__label__0 Just wanted to throw that out there, it has only happened three times since I updated a week or two ago.
__label__0 This drives me crazy and feels like an invasion of privacy.
__label__0 Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement (that can be interacted with using a mouse) for marking emails as read or unread (among other things).

__label__0 The ToastNotification object has a convenient ExpirationTime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period.
__label__0 When porting my Windows 8 app to Windows Phone 8, I feel that the Universal App template (which is already awesome) could do some other things to increase even more productivity: 1 - Create Pages and UserControl folders: Let's face it, unless we want to create sh**** apps, we won't have the same UI for all platforms, so we'll end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions.
__label__0 Since apps aren't allowed to modify files on sd cards I wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been disliked and then remove them.
__label__1 I wish as feedly pro user, if I save the feeds in Evernote I want to tag the note, not only the notebook but also the tag of Evernote.

__label__0 But the “.appxbundle” – package extracted from the *.appxupload (this is the zip-file uploaded to the store) fails at startup after it was side loaded on my test machine.
__label__0 This enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info
__label__0 Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK, we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).

__label__1 Advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application.
__label__0 But my WP app need an alarm.

__label__1 I wish to add content in Evernote with the clearest formatting I can so it needs to be better than Feedly currently supports.
__label__0 Otherwise, it's not a real universal app.
