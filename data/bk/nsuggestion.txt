have an api for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background
for the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone  but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone  maybe timed  maybe because user presses a button on the phone  to send a request  which the service on the phone then handles  some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved  the actual trigger from device to phone could be done with bluetooth le if listening for incomming spp connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories
please provide a api to get the signal strength of a particular bluetooth device  so that we can estimate the distance between windows phone and the device

one possibility  instead of having a top charts style listing  where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere  create a new form of distribution  where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace
highly rated apps should appear near the top more  and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles
it seems to me that all good apps games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts  and waiting to be featured just isn t worth it
another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace
instead of ten featured games per day which all users see  it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed
there are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult  but i feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea  both for developers and for microsoft
highly rated apps should appear near the top more  and they should appear less and less    more

it would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at x hours
i think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didn t view  just like android and ios  but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn wifi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have
i strongly think that more background color s should be there  like instead of just black and white  have blue  red  green and stuff like that and more accent colors
make it so the xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder
better music player  i like the zune on interface or xbox music interface but i would like it so you can do more customization with it and have it so we can move a scroller on the bar that tells you how many minutes have you been playing the song  so that we can skip through the music to our favorite part

wish there was a way for mails  contacts calendars etc to be pulled from an owa url into the email account definitions

wish i can undo that patch

let us open up the phone application  here the the user can see callhistory
also let us open the call history page both are usefull for smart dialing apps
an app can at least have a button directly to call history so user can see call history  since a direct api for call history is not given due to security reasons
file transfer should pause when a call is made or comes in
please improve the performance in next wp release
it would be very useful for some audio applications to turn the speaker on while headset is connected
i would suggest a common credential store such as accounts where users would need to be prompted so the application could access the token  username or password
there should be a way to test applications on real devices without registering in the app hub  because a private person  perhaps  develops an application over a long time and so he pays   each year  only that he can test the application on his mobile

we need the ability for developers to add relevant tags to their app descriptions  we then need the ability to search for apps with those tags  tags should also be verified during app submission to ensure theyre relevant dont know about anyone else but im fed up of the marketplace being swamped with total rubbish  it would be nice to see apps that im interested in instead of a thousand apps that i have no interest in
it will be helpful for many developers if a few sample new project templates which show when and where variables can be created  instantiated so that better app experiences can be given to users
remove useless app or the app uses fake icon  e g
allow to see history for a user group
add a ie like control that support functions like  get url of the current page   which support  open in new tab
for this i would like an user id  anonymous  so my data move to my other phones and delete from phones without logged in live account
there should be a random id instead after every reset
to become regionally recognized  i believe windows phone devices languages should be regionally supported
bing music search should add the ability to learn about the artist and to get the song lyrics for the song it hears
recognition is very accurate  it should be easy to add two buttons for this
