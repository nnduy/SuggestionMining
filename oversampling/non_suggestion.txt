"Over time, these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isn't as fast as it could be."
"While using C++ could provide the necessary access and performance, many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine-grained that dropping to C++ from C# repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower."

"Developers wishing to leverage the Zune media platform to offer improved or tailored podcast playback experiences are currently blocked."
"Instead, an app developer must re-implement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the PC Zune software."
"Once access to a user___s podcast subscriptions and already downloaded episodes is enabled, developers may easily write applications which enhance the existing playback experience."
"This idea could be relatively simply achieved as a new Podcast genre, however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a user___s genres are musical (other than the Ringtone genre?)."
"A better implementation might expose a new property or method on MediaLibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object."

"Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.MediaPlayer.Queue.Activesong populates the .Artist property for music *streamed* from Zune, but not the .Name property, so devs can't know what song is playing."

"Some RITs (resource intensive tasks) do not require comms and it is absurd to wait for connection to WiFi prior to running them."
"Some RITs that ARE comms intensive might use the mobile carrier anyway at user discretion."
"Some power hungry tasks are high priority and should run as soon as external power is available, not wait an hour while the battery charges to 90%."
"Some tasks need to run frequently for very short periods."
"For example, logging GPS position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for 2sec every 30sec with another background task running every 30min for perhaps 30sec to send the batched data to a webservice."

"SSDP (used in UPnP) relies on UDP multicast for discovery."
"Currently UdpAnySourceMulticastClient allows for the listening to existing SSDP traffic, as well as sending a solicitation (M-SEARCH) out requesting that UPnP devices advertise themselves to the solicitor."
"When a device replies to the M-SEARCH message it sends a unicast message to the IP & port that the M-SEARCH message was sent from."

"There's one area where Mango is a retrograde step when compared with NoDo : theme support."
"In NoDo the user could leave the app switch the theme (i.e."
"Dark or Light) & return to the app which would now, in theory, respect their selection."
"In Mango the user's faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system's theme state at start-up."

"Multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how (or be told how) to do it, however it's not very intuitive and I'm concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be."
"Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox -------------------------------------------------------------------- The way it currently works is if you tap and hold, you get the I cursor to appear."
"If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox."
"However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the I cursor makes contact with some text."
"You will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens."
"I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half (allowing for the SIP) a portrait or landscape screen."
"What Would Improve Usability?"
"Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto/visible (latter is currently ignored)."
"Alternatively ---------------- To provide an experience consistent with the platforms SMS text input capability, provide support to allow TextBox to 1. grow as new lines are added."

"They could actually purchase apps on the Marketplace and use them."
"Enable a code-once and runs on Windows or Phone."
"The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters, add audio tracks, crop out a relevant section, etc... of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary."

"And finally memory is very cheap."
"Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone ___ that is ridiculous!"
"If a user wants an application to host content, whether it be 1GB of music or 1GB of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative."

"Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search."

"Do not complain if developers prefer other platforms: you don't make us life easy at all!!"
"Currently you can assign to ApplicationBarIconButton an icon present on your project as 'content'."
"This basically means you have to determine your icons at design time."
"By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage, the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime, dynamically download them from other places etc."
"There is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard."

"They may have been in a country that is not supported for example."
"More then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting."
"Some people may sell their apps to others."
"In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one."
"When I create a paid app with a trial option, many users blow right by it because it doesn't show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free (via the trial)."

"In my view, the two main use cases for the Store search can be summarised as follows: 1.

"The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords."
"It would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two."
"In my view, and I can see from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this, the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two."
"Intuitively, if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular, and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name."
"In addition, app names are quite specific and so searches for 'Facebook' and 'Wordament' should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as 'crosswords'."
"Conversely, new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers, and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the Store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two."
